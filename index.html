            <p>At parties, people no longer give me a blank stare when I tell
                them I write free software. "Oh, yes, open sourceâlike Linux?"
                they say. I nod eagerly in agreement. "Yes, exactly! That's what I
                do." It's nice not to be completely fringe anymore. In the past, the
                next question was usually fairly predictable: "How do you make money
                doing that?" To answer, I'd summarize the economics of open source:
                that there are organizations in whose interest it is to have certain
                software exist, but that they don't need to sell copies, they just
                want to make sure the software is available and maintained, as a tool
                instead of as a commodity.</p>

            <p>The next question is not always about money, though. The
                business case for open source software<sup>[<a name="idp51392" href="#ftn.idp51392"
                                                               class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> is no longer so
                mysterious, and even non-programmers already understandâor at
                least are not surprisedâthat there are people employed at it
                full time. Instead, the next question is often "<span class="emphasis"><em>Oh, how
                    does that work?</em></span>"</p>

            <p>I didn't have a satisfactory answer ready, and the harder I
                tried to come up with one, the more I realized how complex a topic it
                really is. Running a free software project is not exactly like
                running a business (imagine having to constantly negotiate the nature
                of your product with a group of volunteers, most of whom you've never
                met!). Nor, for various reasons, is it exactly like running a
                traditional non-profit organization, nor a government. It has
                similarities to all these things, but I have slowly come to the
                conclusion that free software is <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">sui
                    generis</em></span>. There are many things with which it can be
                usefully compared, but none with which it can be equated. Indeed,
                even the assumption that free software projects can be "run" is a
                stretch. A free software project can be <span class="emphasis"><em>started</em></span>,
                and it can be influenced by interested parties, often quite strongly.
                But its assets cannot be made the property of any single owner, and as
                long as there are people somewhereâanywhereâinterested in
                continuing it, it cannot be unilaterally shut down. Everyone has
                infinite power; everyone has no power. It's an interesting
                dynamic.</p>

            <p>That is why I wanted to write this book in the first place, and
                seven years later, wanted to update it. Free software projects have
                evolved a distinct culture, an ethos in which the liberty to make the
                software do anything one wants is a central tenet. Yet the result of
                this liberty is not a scattering of individuals each going their own
                separate way with the code, but enthusiastic collaboration. Indeed,
                competence at cooperation itself is one of the most highly valued
                skills in free software. To manage these projects is to engage in a
                kind of hypertrophied cooperation, where one's ability not only to
                work with others but to come up with new ways of working together can
                result in tangible benefits to the software. This book attempts to
                describe the techniques by which this may be done. It is by no means
                complete, but it is at least a beginning.</p>

            <p>Good free software is a worthy goal in itself, and I hope that
                readers who come looking for ways to achieve it will be satisfied with
                what they find here. But beyond that I also hope to convey something
                of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of
                open source developers, and from interacting with users in the
                wonderfully direct way that open source encourages. Participating in
                a successful free software project is a deep pleasure, and ultimately
                that's what keeps the whole system going.</p></div>

            <p>This book is meant for software developers and managers who are
                considering starting an open source project, or who have started one
                and are wondering what to do now. It should also be helpful for
                people who just want to participate in an open source project but have
                never done so before.</p>

            <p>The reader need not be a programmer, but should know basic
                software engineering concepts such as APIs, source code, compilers, and
                patches.</p>

            <p>Prior experience with open source software, as either a user or
                a developer, is not necessary. Those who have worked in free software
                projects before will probably find at least some parts of the book a
                bit obvious, and may want to skip those sections. Because there's
                such a potentially wide range of audience experience, I've made an
                effort to label sections clearly, and to say when something can be
                skipped by those already familiar with the material.</p></div>

            <p>Much of the raw material for the first edition of this book came
                from five years of working with the Subversion project (<a class="ulink"
                                                                           href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"
                                                                           target="_top">subversion.tigris.org</a>).
                Subversion is an open source
                version control system, written from scratch, and intended to replace
                CVS as the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> version control
                system of choice in the open source community. The project was
                started by my employer, CollabNet (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_top">collab.net</a>),
                in early 2000,
                and thank goodness
                CollabNet understood right from the start how to run it as a truly
                collaborative, distributed effort. We got a lot of volunteer
                developer buy-in early on; today there are 50-some developers on the
                project, of whom only a few are CollabNet employees.</p>

            <p>Subversion is in many ways a classic example of an open source
                project, and I ended up drawing on it more heavily than I originally
                expected. This was partly a matter of convenience: whenever I needed
                an example of a particular phenomenon, I could usually call one up
                from Subversion right off the top of my head. But it was also a
                matter of verification. Although I am involved in other free software
                projects to varying degrees, and talk to friends and acquaintances
                involved in many more, one quickly realizes when writing for print
                that all assertions need to be fact-checked. I didn't want to make
                statements about events in other projects based only on what I could
                read in their public mailing list archives. If someone were to try
                that with Subversion, I knew, she'd be right about half the time and
                wrong the other half. So when drawing inspiration or examples from a
                project with which I didn't have direct experience, I tried to first
                talk to an informant there, someone I could trust to explain what was
                really going on.</p>

            <p>While Subversion was my full time job from 2000-2006, I've been
                involved in free software for more than twenty years, including the
                seven years since 2006 (when the first edition of this book was
                published). Other projects and organizations that have influenced
                this book include:</p>

            <p>This book took four times longer to write than I thought it
                would, and for much of that time felt rather like a grand piano
                suspended above my head wherever I went. Without help from many
                people, I would not have been able to complete it while staying
                sane.</p>

            <p>Andy Oram, my editor at O'Reilly, was a writer's dream. Aside
                from knowing the field intimately (he suggested many of the topics),
                he has the rare gift of knowing what one meant to say and helping one
                find the right way to say it. It has been an honor to work with him.
                Thanks also to Chuck Toporek for steering this proposal to Andy right
                away.</p>

            <p>Brian Fitzpatrick reviewed almost all of the material as I wrote
                it, which not only made the book better, but kept me writing when I
                wanted to be anywhere in the world but in front of the computer. Ben
                Collins-Sussman and Mike Pilato also checked up on progress, and were
                always happy to discussâsometimes at lengthâwhatever topic
                I was trying to cover that week. They also noticed when I slowed
                down, and gently nagged when necessary. Thanks, guys.</p>

                of the free software movement, giving both ideas and references that I
                was able use in the book. Alex Golubâanother anthropologist
                with one foot in the free software world, and also finishing his
                dissertation at the same timeâwas exceptionally supportive early
                on, which helped a great deal.</p>

            <p>Micah Anderson somehow never seemed too oppressed by his own
                writing gig, which was inspiring in a sick, envy-generating sort of
                way, but he was ever ready with friendship, conversation, and (on at
                least one occasion) technical support. Thanks, Micah!</p>

            <p>Jon Trowbridge and Sander Striker gave both encouragement and
                concrete helpâtheir broad experience in free software provided
                material I couldn't have gotten any other way.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Greg Stein not only for friendship and well-timed
                encouragement, but for showing the Subversion project how important
                regular code review is in building a programming community. Thanks
                also to Brian Behlendorf, who tactfully drummed into our heads the
                importance of having discussions publicly; I hope that principle is
                reflected throughout this book.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Benjamin "Mako" Hill and Seth Schoen, for various
                conversations about free software and its politics; to Zack Urlocker
                and Louis Suarez-Potts for taking time out of their busy schedules to
                be interviewed; to Shane on the Slashcode list for allowing his post
                to be quoted; and to Haggen So for his enormously helpful comparison
                of canned hosting sites.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Alla Dekhtyar, Polina, and Sonya for their unflagging
                and patient encouragement. I'm very glad that I will no longer have
                to end (or rather, try unsuccessfully to end) our evenings early to go
                home and work on "The Book."</p>

            <p>Thanks to Jack Repenning for friendship, conversation, and a
                stubborn refusal to ever accept an easy wrong analysis when a harder
                right one is available. I hope that some of his long experience with
                both software development and the software industry rubbed off on this
                book.</p>

            <p>CollabNet was exceptionally generous in allowing me a flexible
                schedule to write, and didn't complain when it went on far longer than
                originally planned. I don't know all the intricacies of how
                management arrives at such decisions, but I suspect Sandhya Klute, and
                later Mahesh Murthy, had something to do with itâmy thanks to
                them both.</p>

            <p>The entire Subversion development team has been an inspiration
                for the past five years, and much of what is in this book I learned
                from working with them. I won't thank them all by name here, because
                there are too many, but I implore any reader who runs into a
                Subversion committer to immediately buy that committer the drink of
                his choiceâI certainly plan to.</p>

            <p>Many times I ranted to Rachel Scollon about the state of the
                book; she was always willing to listen, and somehow managed to make
                the problems seem smaller than before we talked. That helped a
                lotâthanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks (again) to Noel Taylor, who must surely have wondered why
                I wanted to write another book given how much I complained the last
                time, but whose friendship and leadership of GolosÃ¡ helped keep
                music and good fellowship in my life even in the busiest times.
                Thanks also to Matthew Dean and Dorothea Samtleben, friends and
                long-suffering musical partners, who were very understanding as my
                excuses for not practicing piled up. Megan Jennings was constantly
                supportive, and genuinely interested in the topic even though it was
                unfamiliar to herâa great tonic for an insecure writer. Thanks,
                pal!</p>

            <p>I had four knowledgeable and diligent reviewers for this book:
                Yoav Shapira, Andrew Stellman, Davanum Srinivas, and Ben Hyde. If I
                had been able to incorporate all of their excellent suggestions, this
                would be a better book. As it was, time constraints forced me to pick
                and choose, but the improvements were still significant. Any errors
                that remain are entirely my own.</p>

            <p>My parents, Frances and Henry, were wonderfully supportive as
                always, and as this book is less technical than the previous one, I
                hope they'll find it somewhat more readable.</p>

            <p>Finally, I would like to thank the dedicatees, Karen Underhill
                and Jim Blandy. Karen's friendship and understanding have meant
                everything to me, not only during the writing of this book but for the
                last seven years. I simply would not have finished without her help.
                Likewise for Jim, a true friend and a hacker's hacker, who first
                taught me about free software, much as a bird might teach an airplane
                about flying.</p></div>

            <p>Most free software projects fail.</p>

            <p>We tend not to hear very much about the failures. Only
                successful projects attract attention, and there are so many free
                software projects in total<sup>[<a name="idp5137984" href="#ftn.idp5137984"
                                                   class="footnote">2</a>]</sup> that even though only a small
                percentage
                succeed, the result is still a lot of visible projects. We also don't
                hear about the failures because failure is not an event. There is no
                single moment when a project ceases to be viable; people just sort of
                drift away and stop working on it. There may be a moment when a final
                change is made to the project, but those who made it usually didn't
                know at the time that it was the last one. There is not even a clear
                definition of when a project is expired. Is it when it hasn't been
                actively worked on for six months? When its user base stops growing,
                without having exceeded the developer base? What if the developers of
                one project abandon it because they realized they were duplicating the
                work of anotherâand what if they join that other project, then
                expand it to include much of their earlier effort? Did the first
                project end, or just change homes?</p>

            <p>Because of such complexities, it's impossible to put a precise
                number on the failure rate. But anecdotal evidence from two decades
                in open source, some casting around on multi-project hosting sites
                (see <a class="xref" href="#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the section called âCanned
                    Hostingâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span> for more about
                them), and a little Googling all point to the same conclusion: the
                rate is extremely high, probably on the order of 90â95%. The
                number climbs higher if you include surviving but dysfunctional
                projects: those which <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> producing running code,
                but which are not pleasant places to be, or are not making progress as
                quickly or as dependably as they could.</p>

            <p>This book is about avoiding failure. It examines not only how
                to do things right, but how to do them wrong, so you can recognize and
                correct problems early. My hope is that after reading it, you will
                have a repertory of techniques not just for avoiding common pitfalls
                of open source development, but also for dealing with the growth and
                maintenance of a successful project. Success is not a zero-sum game,
                and this book is not about winning or getting ahead of the
                competition. Indeed, an important part of running an open source
                project is working smoothly with other, related projects. In the long
                run, every successful project contributes to the well-being of the
                overall, worldwide body of free software.</p>

            <p>It would be tempting to say that free software projects fail for
                the same sorts of reasons proprietary software projects do.
                Certainly, free software has no monopoly on unrealistic requirements,
                vague specifications, poor resource management, insufficient design
                phases, or any of the other hobgoblins already well known to the
                software industry. There is a huge body of writing on these topics,
                and I will try not to duplicate it in this book. Instead, I will
                attempt to describe the problems peculiar to free software. When a
                free software project runs aground, it is often because the developers
                (or the managers) did not appreciate the unique problems of open
                source software development, even though they might be quite
                well-prepared for the better-known difficulties of closed-source
                development.</p>

            <p>One of the most common mistakes is unrealistic expectations
                about the benefits of open source itself. An open license does not
                guarantee that hordes of active developers will suddenly volunteer
                their time to your project, nor does open-sourcing a troubled project
                automatically cure its ills. In fact, quite the opposite: opening up
                a project can add whole new sets of complexities, and cost
                <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> in the short term than simply keeping it
                in-house. Opening up means arranging the code to be comprehensible to
                complete strangers, setting up development documentation and email lists,
                and often writing documentation for the first time. All this is a lot
                of work. And of course, if any interested developers
                <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> show up, there is the added burden of
                answering their questions for a while before seeing any benefit from
                their presence. As developer Jamie Zawinski said about the troubled
                early days of the Mozilla project:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Open source does work, but it is most
                    definitely
                    not a panacea. If there's a cautionary tale here, it is that
                    you can't take a dying project, sprinkle it with the magic pixie
                    dust of "open source," and have everything magically work

            </div>
            <p>A related mistake is that of skimping on presentation and
                packaging, figuring that these can always be done later, when the
                project is well under way. Presentation and packaging comprise a wide
                range of tasks, all revolving around the theme of reducing the barrier
                to entry. Making the project inviting to the uninitiated means
                writing user and developer documentation, setting up docs that are
                informative to newcomers, automating as much of the
                software's compilation and installation as possible, etc.</p>

            <p>Many programmers unfortunately treat this kind of work as being
                of secondary importance to the code itself. There are a couple of
                reasons for this. First, it can feel like busywork, because its
                benefits are most visible to those least familiar with the
                project&nbsp;â&nbsp;and vice versa: after all, the people who
                develop the code don't really need the packaging. They already know
                how to install, administer, and use the software, because they wrote
                it. Second, the skills required to do presentation and packaging well
                are often completely different from those required to write code.
                People tend to focus on what they're good at, even if it might serve
                the project better to spend a little time on something that suits them
                less. <a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2,
                    <i>Getting Started</i></a> discusses presentation and
                packaging in detail, and explains why it's crucial that they be a
                priority from the very start of the project.</p>

            <p>Next comes the fallacy that little or no project management is
                required in open source, or conversely, that the same management
                practices used for in-house development will work equally well on an
                open source project. Management in an open source project isn't
                always very visible, but in the successful projects, it's usually
                happening behind the scenes in some form or another. A small thought
                experiment suffices to show why. An open source project consists of a
                random collection of programmersâalready a notoriously
                independent-minded speciesâwho have most likely never met each
                other, and who may each have different personal goals in working on
                the project. The thought experiment is simply to imagine what would
                happen to such a group <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> management.
                Barring miracles, it would collapse or drift apart very quickly.
                Things won't simply run themselves, much as we might wish otherwise.
                But the management, though it may be quite active, is often informal,
                subtle, and low-key. The only thing keeping a development group
                together is their shared belief that they can do more in concert than
                individually. Thus the goal of management is mostly to ensure that
                they continue to believe this, by setting standards for
                communications, by making sure useful developers don't get
                marginalized due to personal idiosyncracies, and in general by making
                the project a place developers want to keep coming back to. Specific
                techniques for doing this are discussed throughout the rest of this
                book.</p>

            <p>Finally, there is a general category of problems that may be
                called "failures of cultural navigation." Twenty years ago, even ten,
                it would have been premature to talk about a global culture of free
                software, but not anymore. A recognizable culture has slowly emerged,
                and while it is certainly not monolithicâit is at least as prone
                to internal dissent and factionalism as any geographically bound
                cultureâit does have a basically consistent core. Most
                successful open source projects exhibit some or all of the
                characteristics of this core. They reward certain types of behaviors,
                and punish others; they create an atmosphere that encourages unplanned
                participation, sometimes at the expense of central coordination; they
                have concepts of rudeness and politeness that can differ substantially
                from those prevalent elsewhere. Most importantly, longtime
                participants have generally internalized these standards, so that they
                share a rough consensus about expected conduct. Unsuccessful projects
                usually deviate in significant ways from this core, albeit
                unintentionally, and often do not have a consensus about what
                constitutes reasonable default behavior. This means that when
                problems arise, the situation can quickly deteriorate, as the
                participants lack an already established stock of cultural reflexes to
                fall back on for resolving differences. </p>

            <p>That last category, failures of cultural navigation, includes an
                interesting phenomenon: certain types of organizations are
                structurally less compatible with open source development than others.
                One of the great surprises for me in preparing the second edition of
                this book was realizing that, on the whole, my experiences indicated
                that governments are less naturally suited to participating in free
                software projects than private-sector, for-profit corporations, with
                non-profits somewhere in between the two. There are many reasons for
                this (see <a class="xref" href="#governments-and-open-source" title="Governments and Open Source">the
                    section called âGovernments and Open Sourceâ</a>), and the
                problems are certainly surmountable, but it's worth noting that when
                an existing organization&nbsp;â&nbsp;particularly a hierarchical
                one, and <span class="emphasis"><em>particularly</em></span> a hierarchical,
                risk-averse, and publicity-sensitive one&nbsp;â&nbsp;starts or
                joins an open source project, some adjustments will usually be
                needed.</p>

            <p>This book is a practical guide, not an anthropological study or
                a history. However, a working knowledge of the origins of today's
                free software culture is an essential foundation for any practical
                advice. A person who understands the culture can travel far and wide
                in the open source world, encountering many local variations in custom
                and dialect, yet still be able to participate comfortably and
                effectively everywhere. In contrast, a person who does not understand
                the culture will find the process of organizing or participating in a
                project difficult and full of surprises. Since the number of people
                developing free software is still growing by leaps and bounds, there
                are many people in that latter categoryâthis is largely a
                culture of recent immigrants, and will continue to be so for some
                time. If you think you might be one of them, the next section
                provides background for discussions you'll encounter later, both in
                this book and on the Internet. (On the other hand, if you've been
                working with open source for a while, you may already know a lot of
                its history, so feel free to skip the next section.)</p></div>

            <p>Software sharing has been around as long as software itself. In
                the early days of computers, manufacturers felt that competitive
                advantages were to be had mainly in hardware innovation, and therefore
                didn't pay much attention to software as a business asset. Many of
                the customers for these early machines were scientists or technicians,
                who were able to modify and extend the software shipped with the
                machine themselves. Customers sometimes distributed their patches
                back not only to the manufacturer, but to other owners of similar
                machines. The manufacturers often tolerated and even encouraged this:
                in their eyes, improvements to the software, from whatever source,
                just made the hardware more attractive to other potential
                customers.</p>

            <p>Although this early period resembled today's free software
                culture in many ways, it differed in two crucial respects. First,
                there was as yet little standardization of hardwareâit was a
                time of flourishing innovation in computer design, but the diversity
                of computing architectures meant that everything was incompatible with
                everything else. Software written for one machine would
                generally not work on another; programmers tended to acquire
                expertise in a particular architecture or family of architectures
                (whereas today they would be more likely to acquire expertise in a
                programming language or family of languages, confident that their
                expertise will be transferable to whatever computing hardware they
                happen to find themselves working with). Because a person's expertise
                tended to be specific to one kind of computer, their accumulation of
                expertise had the effect of making that particular architecture
                computer more attractive to them and their colleagues. It was
                therefore in the manufacturer's interests for machine-specific code
                and knowledge to spread as widely as possible.</p>

            <p>Second, there was no widespread Internet. Though there were
                fewer legal restrictions on sharing than there are today, the
                technical restrictions were greater: the means of getting data from
                place to place were inconvenient and cumbersome, relatively speaking.
                There were some small, local networks, good for sharing information
                among employees at the same lab or company. But there remained
                barriers to overcome if one wanted to share with the world. These
                barriers <span class="emphasis"><em>were</em></span> overcome in many cases. Sometimes
                different groups made contact with each other independently, sending
                disks or tapes through land mail, and sometimes the manufacturers
                themselves served as central clearing houses for patches. It also
                helped that many of the early computer developers worked at
                universities, where publishing one's knowledge was expected. But the
                physical realities of data transmission meant there was always an
                impedance to sharing, an impedance proportional to the distance (real
                or organizational) that the software had to travel. Widespread,
                frictionless sharing, as we know it today, was not possible.</p>

                <p>As the industry matured, several interrelated changes occurred
                    simultaneously. The wild diversity of hardware designs gradually gave
                    way to a few clear winnersâwinners through superior technology,
                    superior marketing, or some combination of the two. At the same time,
                    and not entirely coincidentally, the development of so-called "high
                    level" programming languages meant that one could write a program
                    once, in one language, and have it automatically translated
                    ("compiled") to run on different kinds of computers. The implications
                    of this were not lost on the hardware manufacturers: a customer could
                    now undertake a major software engineering effort without necessarily
                    locking themselves into one particular computer architecture. When
                    this was combined with the gradual narrowing of performance
                    differences between various computers, as the less efficient designs
                    were weeded out, a manufacturer that treated its hardware as its only
                    asset could look forward to a future of declining profit margins. Raw
                    computing power was becoming a fungible good, while software was
                    becoming the differentiator. Selling software, or at least treating
                    it as an integral part of hardware sales, began to look like a good
                    strategy.</p>

                <p>This meant that manufacturers had to start enforcing the
                    copyrights on their code more strictly. If users simply continued to
                    share and modify code freely among themselves, they might
                    independently reimplement some of the improvements now being sold as
                    "added value" by the supplier. Worse, shared code could get into the
                    hands of competitors. The irony is that all this was happening around
                    the time the Internet was getting off the ground. So just when truly
                    unobstructed software sharing was finally becoming technically
                    possible, changes in the computer business made it economically
                    undesirable, at least from the point of view of any single company.
                    The suppliers clamped down, either denying users access to the code
                    that ran their machines, or insisting on non-disclosure agreements
                    that made effective sharing impossible.</p>

                    <p>As the world of unrestricted code swapping slowly faded away, a
                        counterreaction crystallized in the mind of at least one programmer.
                        Richard Stallman worked in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s and early '80s,
                        during what turned out to be a golden age and a golden location for
                        code sharing. The AI Lab had a strong "hacker
                        ethic",<sup>[<a name="idp5217136" href="#ftn.idp5217136" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> and
                        people were not only encouraged but
                        expected to share whatever improvements they made to the system. As
                        Stallman wrote later:</p>

                    <div class="blockquote">

                            Whenever people from another university or a company wanted to

                    <p>This Edenic community collapsed around Stallman shortly after
                        1980, when the changes that had been happening in the rest of the
                        industry finally caught up with the AI Lab. A startup company hired
                        away many of the Lab's programmers to work on an operating system
                        similar to what they had been working on at the Lab, only now under an
                        exclusive license. At the same time, the AI Lab acquired new
                        equipment that came with a proprietary operating system.</p>

                    <p>Stallman saw the larger pattern in what was happening:</p>

                    <p>By some quirk of personality, he decided to resist the trend.
                        Instead of continuing to work at the now-decimated AI Lab, or taking a
                        job writing code at one of the new companies, where the results of his
                        work would be kept locked in a box, he resigned from the Lab and
                        started the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The
                        goal of GNU<sup>[<a name="idp5225264" href="#ftn.idp5225264" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup> was
                        to develop a completely free and open
                        computer operating system and body of application software, in which
                        users would never be prevented from hacking or from sharing their
                        modifications. He was, in essence, setting out to recreate what had
                        been destroyed at the AI Lab, but on a world-wide scale and without
                        the vulnerabilities that had made the AI Lab's culture susceptible to
                        disintegration.</p>

                    <p>In addition to working on the new operating system, Stallman
                        devised a copyright license whose terms guaranteed that his code would
                        be perpetually free. The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a clever
                        piece of legal judo: it says that the code may be copied and modified
                        without restriction, and that both copies and derivative works (i.e.,
                        modified versions) must be distributed under the same license as the
                        original, with no additional restrictions. In effect, it uses
                        copyright law to achieve an effect opposite to that of traditional
                        copyright: instead of limiting the software's distribution, it
                        prevents <span class="emphasis"><em>anyone</em></span>, even the author, from limiting
                        distribution. For Stallman, this was better than simply putting his
                        code into the public domain. If it were in the public domain, any
                        particular copy of it could be incorporated into a proprietary program
                        (as also sometimes happens to code under permissive open source
                        copyright licenses <sup>[<a name="idp5228032" href="#ftn.idp5228032"
                                                    class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>). While
                        such incorporation wouldn't in
                        any way diminish the original code's continued availability, it would
                        have meant that Stallman's efforts could benefit the
                        enemyâproprietary software. The GPL can be thought of as a form
                        of protectionism for free software, because it prevents non-free
                        software from taking full advantage of GPLed code. The GPL and its
                        relationship to other free software licenses are discussed in detail
                        in <a class="xref" href="#legal"

                    <p>With the help of many programmers, some of whom shared
                        Stallman's ideology and some of whom simply wanted to see a lot of
                        free code available, the GNU Project began releasing free replacements
                        for many of the most critical components of an operating system.
                        Because of the now-widespread standardization in computer hardware and
                        software, it was possible to use the GNU replacements on otherwise
                        non-free systems, and many people did. The GNU text editor (Emacs)
                        and C compiler (GCC) were particularly successful, gaining large and
                        loyal followings not on ideological grounds, but simply on their
                        technical merits. By about 1990, GNU had produced most of a free
                        operating system, except for the kernelâthe part that the
                        machine actually boots up, and that is responsible for managing memory,
                        disk, and other system resources.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, the GNU project had chosen a kernel design that
                        turned out to be harder to implement than expected. The ensuing delay
                        prevented the Free Software Foundation from making the first release
                        of an entirely free operating system. The final piece was put into
                        place instead by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student
                        who, with the help of volunteers around the world, had completed a
                        free kernel using a more conservative design. He named it Linux, and
                        when it was combined with the existing GNU programs and other free
                        software (especially the X Windows System), the result was a
                        completely free operating system. For the first time, you could boot
                        up your computer and do work without using any proprietary
                        software.<sup>[<a name="idp5231520" href="#ftn.idp5231520" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup></p>

                    <p>Much of the software on this new operating system was not
                        produced by the GNU project. In fact, GNU wasn't even the only group
                        working on producing a free operating system (for example, the code
                        that eventually became NetBSD and FreeBSD was already under
                        development by this time). The importance of the Free Software
                        Foundation was not only in the code they wrote, but in their political
                        rhetoric. By talking about free software as a cause instead of a
                        convenience, they made it difficult for
                        programmers <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have a political consciousness
                        about it. Even those who disagreed with the FSF had to engage the
                        issue, if only to stake out a different position. The FSF's
                        effectiveness as propagandists lay in tying their code to a message,
                        by means of the GPL and other texts. As their code spread widely,
                        that message spread as well.</p></div>

                    <p>There were many other things going on in the nascent free
                        software scene, however, and not all were as explictly ideological as
                        Stallman's GNU Project. One of the most important was
                        the <em class="firstterm">Berkeley Software Distribution</em>
                        (<em class="firstterm">BSD</em>), a gradual re-implementation of the Unix
                        operating systemâwhich up until the late 1970's had been a
                        loosely proprietary research project at AT&amp;Tâby programmers
                        at the University of California at Berkeley. The BSD group did not
                        make any overt political statements about the need for programmers to
                        band together and share with one another, but they
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>practiced</em></span> the idea with flair and
                        enthusiasm, by coordinating a massive distributed development effort
                        in which the Unix command-line utilities and code libraries, and
                        eventually the operating system kernel itself, were rewritten from
                        scratch mostly by volunteers. The BSD project became a prime example
                        of non-ideological free software development, and also served as a
                        training ground for many developers who would go on to remain active
                        in the open source world.</p>

                    <p>Another crucible of cooperative development was the <em class="firstterm">X
                        Window System</em>, a free, network-transparent graphical
                        computing environment, developed at MIT in the mid-1980's in
                        partnership with hardware vendors who had a common interest in being
                        able to offer their customers a windowing system. Far from opposing
                        proprietary software, the X license deliberately allowed proprietary
                        extensions on top of the free coreâeach member of the consortium
                        wanted the chance to enhance the default X distribution, and thereby
                        gain a competitive advantage over the other members. X
                        Windows<sup>[<a name="idp5231984" href="#ftn.idp5231984" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup> itself
                        was free
                        software, but mainly as a way to level the playing field between
                        competing business interests and increase standardization, not out of
                        some desire to end the
                        dominance of proprietary software. Yet another example, predating the
                        GNU project by a few years, was TeX, Donald Knuth's free,
                        publishing-quality typesetting system. He released it under terms
                        that allowed anyone to modify and distribute the code, but not to call
                        the result "TeX" unless it passed a very strict set of compatibility
                        tests (this is an example of the "trademark-protecting" class of free
                        licenses, discussed more in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
                                                       title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10,
                            <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a>). Knuth wasn't
                        taking a stand one way or the other on the question of
                        free-versus-proprietary software; he just needed a better typesetting
                        system in order to complete his
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> goalâa book on computer
                        programmingâand saw no reason not to release his system to the
                        world when done.</p></div>
                <p>Without listing every project and every license, it's safe to
                    say that by the late 1980's, there was a lot of free software
                    available under a wide variety of licenses. The diversity of licenses
                    reflected a corresponding diversity of motivations. Even some of the
                    programmers who chose the GNU GPL were much less ideologically driven
                    than the GNU project itself was. Although they enjoyed working on free
                    software, many developers did not consider proprietary software a
                    social evil. There were people who felt a moral impulse to rid the
                    world of "software hoarding" (Stallman's term for non-free software),
                    but others were motivated more by technical excitement, or by the
                    pleasure of working with like-minded collaborators, or even by a
                    simple human desire for glory. Yet by and large these disparate
                    motivations did not interact in destructive ways. This may be
                    because software, unlike other creative forms like prose or the visual
                    arts, must pass semi-objective tests in order to be considered
                    successful: it must run, and be reasonably free of bugs. This gives
                    all participants in a project a kind of automatic common ground, a
                    reason and a framework for working together without worrying too much
                    about qualifications or motivations beyond the technical.</p>

                <p>Developers had another reason to stick together as well: it
                    turned out that the free software world was producing some very
                    high-quality code. In some cases, it was demonstrably technically
                    superior to the nearest non-free alternative; in others, it was at
                    least comparable, and of course it always cost less. While only a few
                    people might have been motivated to run free software on strictly
                    philosophical grounds, a great many people were happy to run it
                    because it did a better job. And of those who used it, some
                    percentage were always willing to donate their time and skills to help
                    maintain and improve the software.</p>

                <p>This tendency to produce good code was certainly not universal,
                    but it was happening with increasing frequency in free software
                    projects around the world. Businesses that depended heavily on
                    software gradually began to take notice. Many of them discovered that
                    they were already using free software in day-to-day operations, and
                    simply hadn't known it (upper management isn't always aware of
                    everything the IT department does). Corporations began to take a more
                    active and public role in free software projects, contributing time
                    and equipment, and sometimes even directly funding the development of
                    free programs. Such investments could, in the best scenarios, repay
                    themselves many times over. The sponsor only pays a small number of
                    expert programmers to devote themselves to the project full time, but
                    reaps the benefits of <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone's</em></span> contributions,
                    including work from unpaid volunteers and from programmers being paid
                    by other corporations.</p></div>

                <p>As the corporate world gave more and more attention to free
                    software, programmers were faced with new issues of presentation. One
                    was the word "free" itself. On first hearing the term "free software"
                    many people mistakenly think it means just "zero-cost software." It's
                    true that all free software is zero-cost,<sup>[<a name="idp5251120" href="#ftn.idp5251120"
                                                                      class="footnote">8</a>]</sup>
                    but not all zero-cost software is free as in "freedom"âthat is,
                    the freedom to share and modify for any purpose. For example, during the
                    battle of the browsers in the 1990s, both Netscape and Microsoft gave
                    away their competing web browsers at no charge, in a scramble to gain
                    market share. Neither browser was free in the "free software" sense.
                    You couldn't get the source code, and even if you could, you didn't
                    have the right to modify or redistribute it.<sup>[<a name="idp5241200" href="#ftn.idp5241200"
                                                                         class="footnote">9</a>]</sup>
                    The only thing
                    you could do was download an executable and run it. The browsers were
                    no more free than shrink-wrapped software bought in a store; they
                    merely had a lower price.</p>

                <p>This confusion over the word "free" is due entirely to an
                    unfortunate ambiguity in the English language. Most other tongues
                    distinguish low prices from liberty (the distinction between
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>gratis</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>libre</em></span> is
                    immediately clear to speakers of Romance languages, for example). But
                    English's position as the de facto bridge language of the Internet
                    means that a problem with English is, to some degree, a problem for
                    everyone. The misunderstanding around the word "free" was so
                    prevalent that free software programmers eventually evolved a standard
                    formula in response: "It's <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> as in
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>freedom</em></span>âthink <span class="emphasis"><em>free
                        speech</em></span>, not <span class="emphasis"><em>free beer</em></span>." Still, having
                    to explain it over and over is tiring. Many programmers felt, with
                    some justification, that the ambiguous word "free" was hampering the
                    public's understanding of this software.</p>

                <p>But the problem went deeper than that. The word "free" carried
                    with it an inescapable moral connotation: if freedom was an end in
                    itself, it didn't matter whether free software also happened to
                    be better, or more profitable for certain businesses in certain
                    circumstances. Those were merely pleasant side effects of a motive
                    that was, at its root, neither technical nor mercantile, but moral.
                    Furthermore, the "free as in freedom" position forced a glaring
                    inconsistency on corporations who wanted to support particular free
                    programs in one aspect of their business, but continue marketing
                    proprietary software in others.</p>

                <p>These dilemmas came to a community that was already poised for
                    an identity crisis. The programmers who actually
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>write</em></span> free software have never been of one mind
                    about the overall goal, if any, of the free software movement. Even
                    to say that opinions run from one extreme to the other would be
                    misleading, in that it would falsely imply a linear range where there
                    is instead a multidimensional scattering. However, two broad
                    categories of belief can be distinguished, if we are willing to ignore
                    subtleties for the moment. One group takes Stallman's view, that the
                    freedom to share and modify is the most important thing, and that
                    therefore if you stop talking about freedom, you've left out the core
                    issue. Others feel that the software itself is the most important
                    argument in its favor, and are uncomfortable with proclaiming
                    proprietary software inherently bad. Some, but not all, free
                    software programmers believe that the author (or employer, in the case
                    of paid work)
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> have the right to control the terms of
                    distribution, and that no moral judgement need be attached to the
                    choice of particular terms. Others don't believe this.</p>

                <p>For a long time, these differences did not need to be carefully
                    examined or articulated, but free software's burgeoning success in the
                    business world made the issue unavoidable. In 1998, the term
                    <em class="firstterm">open&nbsp;source</em> was created as an alternative
                    to "free", by a coalition of programmers who eventually became The
                    Open Source Initiative (OSI).<sup>[<a name="idp5262144" href="#ftn.idp5262144"

                    not only that "free software" was potentially confusing, but that the
                    word "free" was just one symptom of a general problem: that the
                    movement needed a marketing program to pitch it to the corporate
                    world, and that talk of morals and the social benefits of sharing
                    would never fly in corporate boardrooms. In their own words at the

                <p>The tips of many icebergs of controversy are visible in that
                    text. It refers to "our convictions", but smartly avoids spelling out
                    exactly what those convictions are. For some, it might be the
                    conviction that code developed according to an open process will be
                    better code; for others, it might be the conviction that all
                    information should be shared. There's the use of the word "theft" to
                    refer (presumably) to illegal copyingâa usage that many object
                    to, on the grounds that it's not theft if the original possessor still
                    has the item afterwards. There's the tantalizing hint that the free
                    software movement might be mistakenly accused of anti-commercialism,
                    but it leaves carefully unexamined the question of whether such an
                    accusation would have any basis in fact.</p>

                <p>None of which is to say that the OSI's web site is inconsistent
                    or misleading. It's not. Rather, it is an example of exactly what
                    the OSI claims had been missing from the free software movement: good
                    marketing, where "good" means "viable in the business world." The
                    Open Source Initiative gave a lot of people exactly what they had been
                    looking forâa vocabulary for talking about free software as a
                    development methodology and business strategy, instead of as a moral
                    crusade.</p></div>
            <p>The appearance of the Open Source Initiative changed the
                landscape of free software. It formalized a dichotomy that had long
                been unnamed, and in doing so forced the movement to acknowledge that
                it had internal politics as well as external. The effect today is
                that both sides have had to find common ground, since most projects
                include programmers from both camps, as well as participants who don't
                fit any clear category. This doesn't mean people never talk about
                moral motivationsâlapses in the traditional "hacker ethic" are
                sometimes called out, for example. But it is rare for a free software
                / open source developer to openly question the basic motivations of
                others in a project. The contribution trumps the contributor. If
                someone writes good code, you don't ask them whether they do it for
                moral reasons, or because their employer paid them to, or because
                they're building up their rÃ©sumÃ©, or whatever. You evaluate
                the contribution on technical grounds, and respond on technical
                grounds. Even explicitly political organizations like the Debian
                project, whose goal is to offer a 100% free (that is, "free as in
                freedom") computing environment, are fairly relaxed about integrating
                with non-free code and cooperating with programmers who don't share
                exactly the same goals.</p></div>

            <p>When running a free software project, you won't need to talk
                about such weighty philosophical matters on a daily basis.
                Programmers will not insist that everyone else in the project agree
                with their views on all things (those who do insist on this quickly
                find themselves unable to work in any project). But you do need to be
                aware that the question of "free" versus "open source" exists, partly
                to avoid saying things that might be inimical to some of the
                participants, and partly because understanding developers' motivations
                is the best wayâin some sense, the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
                wayâto manage a project.</p>

            <p>Free software is a culture by choice. To operate successfully
                in it, you have to understand why people choose to be in it in the
                first place. Coercive techniques don't work. If people are unhappy in
                one project, they will just wander off to another one. Free software
                is remarkable even among volunteer communities for its lightness of
                investment. Most of the people involved have never actually met the
                other participants face-to-face, and simply donate bits of time
                whenever they feel like it. The normal conduits by which humans bond
                with each other and form lasting groups are narrowed down to a tiny
                channel: the written word, carried over electronic wires. Because of
                this, it can take a long time for a cohesive and dedicated group to
                form. Conversely, it's quite easy for a project to lose a potential
                volunteer in the first five minutes of acquaintanceship. If a project
                doesn't make a good first impression, newcomers may wait a long time
                before giving it a second chance.</p>

            <p>The transience, or rather the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span>
                transience, of relationships is perhaps the single most daunting task
                facing a new project. What will persuade all these people to stick
                together long enough to produce something useful? The answer to that
                question is complex enough to occupy the rest of this book, but if it
                had to be expressed in one sentence, it would be this:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>People should feel that their connection to
                    a
                    project, and influence over it, is directly proportional to
                    their contributions.</em></span></p></blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>No class of developers, or potential developers, should ever
                feel discounted or discriminated against for non-technical
                reasons<sup>[<a name="idp5143952" href="#ftn.idp5143952" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup>.
                Clearly, projects with corporate
                sponsorship and/or salaried developers need to be especially careful
                in this regard, as <a class="xref" href="#money" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Money">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Money</i></a>
                discusses in detail. Of
                course, this doesn't mean that if there's no corporate sponsorship
                then you have nothing to worry about. Money is merely one of many
                factors that can affect the success of a project. There are also
                questions of what language to choose, what license, what development
                process, precisely what kind of infrastructure to set up, how to
                publicize the project's inception effectively, and much more.

            <p>The classic model of how free software projects get started was
                supplied by Eric Raymond, in a now-famous paper on open source
                processes entitled <em class="citetitle">The Cathedral and the
                    Bazaar</em>. He wrote:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Every good work of software starts by
                    scratching
                    a developer's personal itch.</em></span></p>

                    <p>(from <span class="bold"><strong><a class="ulink"
                                                           href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/"
                                                           target="_top">catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/</a>
                    </strong></span>)</p></blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>Note that Raymond wasn't saying that open source projects happen
                only when some individual gets an itch. Rather, he was saying that
                <span class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span> software results when the programmer has a
                personal interest in seeing the problem solved; the relevance of this
                to free software was that a personal itch happened to be the most
                frequent motivation for starting a free software project.</p>

            <p>This is still how most free software projects are started, but less so
                now than in 1997, when Raymond wrote those words. Today, we have the
                phenomenon of organizationsâfor-profit corporations,
                governments, non-profits, etcâstarting large, centrally-conceived
                open source
                projects from scratch. The lone programmer, banging out some code to
                solve a local problem and then realizing the result has wider
                applicability, is still the source of much new free software, but is
                not the only story.</p>

            <p>Raymond's point is still insightful, however. The essential
                condition is that the producers of the software have a direct interest
                in its success, usually because they use it themselves or work
                directly with people who use it. If the software
                doesn't do what it's supposed to do, the person or organization
                producing it will feel the dissatisfaction in their daily work. For
                example, the open source software developed by the Kuali Foundation
                (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kuali.org/" target="_top">kuali.org</a>), used by educational
                institutions to manage their finances, research grants, HR systems,
                student information, etc, can hardly be said to scratch any individual
                programmer's personal itch. It
                scratches an institutional itch. But that itch arises directly from
                the experiences of the institutions concerned, and therefore if
                the project fails to satisfy them, they will know. This arrangement
                produces good software because the feedback loop flows in the right
                direction. The program isn't being written to be sold to someone else
                so they can solve <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> problem. It's being
                written to solve one's <span class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> problem, and then
                shared with everyone, much as though the problem were a disease and
                the software were medicine whose distribution is meant to completely
                eradicate the epidemic.</p>

            <p>This chapter is about how to introduce a new free software
                project to the world, but many of its recommendations would sound
                familiar to a health organization distributing medicine. The goals
                are very similar: you want to make it clear what the medicine does,
                get it into the hands of the right people, and make sure that those
                who receive it know how to use it. But with software, you also want
                to entice some of the recipients into joining the ongoing research
                effort to improve the medicine.</p>

            <p>Free software distribution is a twofold task. The software
                needs to acquire users, and to acquire developers. These two needs
                are not necessarily in conflict, but they do add some complexity to a
                project's initial presentation. Some information is useful for both
                audiences, some is useful only for one or the other. Both kinds of
                information should subscribe to the principle of scaled presentation;
                that is, the degree of detail presented at each stage should
                correspond to the amount of time and effort put in by the
                reader at that stage. More effort should always result in more
                reward. When the two do
                not correlate tightly, people may quickly lose faith and stop
                investing effort.</p>

            <p>The corollary to this is that <span class="emphasis"><em>appearances
                matter</em></span>. Programmers, in particular, often don't like to
                believe this. Their love of substance over form is almost a point of
                professional pride. It's no accident that so many programmers exhibit
                an antipathy for marketing and public relations work, nor that
                professional graphic designers are often horrified at the designs
                programmers come up with on their own.</p>

            <p>This is a pity, because there are situations where form
                <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> substance, and project presentation is one of
                them. For example, the very first thing a visitor learns about a
                project is what its web site looks like. This information is absorbed
                before any of the actual content on the site is
                comprehendedâbefore any of the text has been read or links
                clicked on. However unjust it may be, people cannot stop themselves
                from forming an immediate first impression. The site's appearance
                signals whether care was taken in organizing the project's
                presentation. Humans have extremely sensitive antennae for detecting
                the investment of care. Most of us can tell in one glance whether a
                web site was thrown together quickly or was given serious thought.
                This is the first piece of information your project puts out, and the
                impression it creates will carry over to the rest of the project by
                association.</p>

            <p>Thus, while much of this chapter talks about the content your
                project should start out with, remember that its look and feel matter
                too. Because the project web site has to work for two different types
                of visitorsâusers and developersâspecial attention
                must be paid to clarity and directedness. Although this is not the
                place for a general treatise on web design, one principle is important
                enough to deserve mention, particularly when the site serves multiple
                (if overlapping) audiences: people should have a rough idea where a
                link goes before clicking on it. For example, it should be obvious
                <span class="emphasis"><em>from looking at the links</em></span> to user documentation
                that they lead to user documentation, and not to, say, developer
                documentation. Running a project is partly about supplying
                information, but it's also about supplying comfort. The mere presence
                of certain standard offerings, in expected places, reassures users and
                developers who are deciding whether they want to get involved. It
                says that this project has its act together, has anticipated the
                questions people will ask, and has made an effort to answer them in a
                way that requires minimal exertion on the part of the asker. By
                giving off this aura of preparedness, the project sends out a message:
                "Your time will not be wasted if you get involved," which is exactly
                what people need to hear.</p>

            <p>If you use a "canned hosting" site (see <a class="xref" href="#starting-with-canned-hosting">the section
                called âHostingâ</a>), one advantage of that
                choice is that those sites have a default layout that is similar from
                project to project, and is pretty well-suited to presenting a project
                to the world. That layout can be customized, within certain
                boundaries, but the default design prompts you to include the
                information visitors are most likely to be looking for.</p>

                <p>Before starting an open source project, there is one important
                    caveat:</p>

                <p>Always look around to see if there's an existing project that
                    does what you want. The chances are pretty good that whatever problem
                    you want solved now, someone else wanted solved before you. If they
                    did solve it, and released their code under a free license, then
                    there's no reason for you to reinvent the wheel today. There are
                    exceptions, of course: if you want to start a project as an
                    educational experience, pre-existing code won't help; or maybe the
                    project you have in mind is so specialized that you know there is zero
                    chance anyone else has done it. But generally, there's no point not
                    looking, and the payoff can be huge. If the usual Internet search
                    engines don't turn up anything, try searching directly on <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/"

                    might find something so close that it makes more sense to join that
                    project and add functionality than to start from scratch
                    yourself.</p></div>

            <p>You've looked around, found that nothing out there really fits
                your needs, and decided to start a new project.</p>

            <p>What now?</p>

            <p>The hardest part about launching a free software project is
                transforming a private vision into a public one. You or your
                organization may know perfectly well what you want, but expressing
                that goal comprehensibly to the world is a fair amount of work. It is
                essential, however, that you take the time to do it. You and the
                other founders must decide what the project is really aboutâthat
                is, decide its limitations, what it <span class="emphasis"><em>won't</em></span> do as
                well as what it willâand write up a mission statement. This
                part is usually not too hard, though it can sometimes reveal unspoken
                assumptions and even disagreements about the nature of the project,
                which is fine: better to resolve those now than later. The next step
                is to package up the project for public consumption, and this is,
                basically, pure drudgery.</p>

            <p>What makes it so laborious is that it consists mainly of
                organizing and documenting things everyone already
                knowsâ"everyone", that is, who's been involved in the project so
                far. Thus, for the people doing the work, there is no immediate
                benefit. They do not need a <code class="filename">README</code> file giving
                an overview of the project, nor a design document.
                They do not need a carefully arranged code tree conforming to the
                informal but widespread standards of software source distributions.
                Whatever way the source code is arranged is fine for them, because
                they're already accustomed to it anyway, and if the code runs at all,
                they know how to use it. It doesn't even matter, for them, if the
                fundamental architectural assumptions of the project remain
                undocumented; they're already familiar with that too.</p>

            <p>Newcomers, on the other hand, need all these things. Fortunately,
                they don't need them all at once. It's not necessary for you to
                provide every possible resource before taking a project public. In a
                perfect world, perhaps, every new open source project would start out
                life with a thorough design document, a complete user manual (with
                special markings for features planned but not yet implemented),
                beautifully and portably packaged code, capable of running on any
                computing platform, and so on. In reality, taking care of all these
                loose ends would be prohibitively time-consuming, and anyway, it's
                work that one can reasonably hope others will help with once the
                project is under way.</p>

            <p>What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> necessary, however, is that enough
                investment be put into presentation that newcomers can get past the
                initial obstacle of unfamiliarity. Think of it as the first step in a
                bootstrapping process, to bring the project to a kind of minimum
                activation energy. I've heard this threshold called the
                <em class="firstterm">hacktivation energy</em>: the amount of energy a
                newcomer must put in before she starts getting something back. The
                lower a project's hacktivation energy, the better. Your first task is
                bring the hacktivation energy down to a level that encourages people
                to get involved.</p>

            <p>Each of the following subsections describes one important aspect
                of starting a new project. They are presented roughly in the order
                that a new visitor would encounter them, though of course the order in
                which you actually implement them might be different. You can treat
                them as a checklist. When starting a project, just go down the list
                and make sure you've got each item covered, or at least that you're
                comfortable with the potential consequences if you've left one
                out.</p>

                    project, perhaps by having stumbled across it while searching for
                    software to solve some problem. The first thing they'll encounter is
                    the project's name.</p>

                <p>A good name will not automatically make your project successful,
                    and a bad name will not doom itâwell, a
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> bad name probably could do that, but we
                    start from the assumption that no one here is actively trying to make
                    their project fail. However, a bad name can slow down adoption of the
                    project, either because people don't take it seriously, or because
                    they simply have trouble remembering it.</p>

                            "easy for someone who can read English to remember." Names that

                    <p>For large projects, it is a good idea to own the project's name
                        as many of the relevant namespaces on the Internet as you can. By
                        namespaces, I mean not just the domain name system, but also online
                        services in which account names (usernames) are the publicly visible
                        handle by which people refer to the project. If you have the same
                        name in all the places where people would look for you, you make it
                        easier for people to sustain a mild interest in the project until
                        they're ready to become more involved.</p>

                    <p>For example, the Gnome free desktop project has the <a class="ulink" href="http://gnome.org/"
                                                                              target="_top">gnome.org</a> domain

                        the <a class="ulink" href="https://identi.ca/gnome" target="_top">gnome</a> username at

                        GitHub.com<sup>[<a name="idp5454080" href="#ftn.idp5454080" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup>, and
                        on the freenode IRC
                        network (see <a class="xref" href="#irc" title="IRC / Real-Time Chat Systems">the section called
                            âIRC / Real-Time Chat Systemsâ</a>) they have the channel
                        <code class="code">#gnome</code>, although they also maintain their own IRC servers
                        (where they control the channel namespace anyway, of course).</p>

                    <p>All this makes the Gnome project splendidly easy to find: it's
                        usually right where a potential contributor would expect it to be. Of
                        course, Gnome is a large and complex project with thousands of
                        contributors and many subdivisions; the advantage to Gnome of being
                        easy to find is greater than it would be for a newer project, since by
                        now there are so many ways to get involved in Gnome. But it will
                        certainly never <span class="emphasis"><em>harm</em></span> your project to own its name
                        in as many of the relevant namespaces as it can, and it can sometimes
                        help. So when you start a project, think about what its online handle
                        should be and register that handle with the online services you think
                        you're likely to care about. The ones mentioned above are probably a
                        good initial list, but you may know others that are relevant for the
                        particular subject area of your project.</p></div>

                    decide (within 30 seconds) whether or not they're interested in
                    learning more. This should be prominently placed on the front page,
                    preferably right under the project's name.</p>

                <p>The description should be concrete, limiting, and above all,
                    short. Here's an example of a good one, from <a class="ulink" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/"
                                                                    target="_top">hadoop.apache.org</a>:</p>

                <p>In just four sentences, they've hit all the high points, largely
                    by drawing on the reader's prior knowledge. That's an important
                    point: it's okay to assume a minimally informed reader with a baseline
                    level of preparedness. A reader who doesn't know what "clusters" and
                    "high-availability" mean in this context probably can't make much use
                    of Hadoop anyway, so there's no point writing for a reader who knows
                    any less than that. The phrase "designed to detect and handle
                    failures at the application layer" will stand out to engineers who
                    have experience with large-scale computing clustersâwhen they
                    see those words, they'll know that the people behind Hadoop understand
                    that world, and will thus be more willing to give Hadoop
                    consideration.</p>

                <p>Those who remain interested after reading the mission statement
                    will next want to see more details, perhaps some user or developer
                    documentation, and eventually will want to download something. But
                    before any of that, they'll need to be sure it's open source.</p></div>

                    would be surprised how many projects forget to do it. I have seen
                    free software project web sites where the front page not only did not
                    say which particular free license the software was distributed under,
                    but did not even state outright that the software was free at all.
                    Sometimes the crucial bit of information was relegated to the
                    Downloads page, or the Developers page, or some other place that
                    required one more mouse click to get to. In extreme cases, the
                    license was not given anywhere on the web site at allâthe only
                    way to find it was to download the software and look at a license file

                    mission statement, that the project is "free software" or "open source
                    software", and give the exact license. A quick guide to choosing a

                <p>By this point, our hypothetical visitor has
                    determinedâprobably in a minute or lessâthat she's
                    interested in spending, say, at least five more minutes investigating
                    this project. The next sections describe what she should encounter in

                </div>
                <p>There should be a brief list of the features the software
                    supports (if something isn't completed yet, you can still list it, but
                    put "<span class="emphasis"><em>planned</em></span>" or
                    "<span class="emphasis"><em>in&nbsp;progress</em></span>" next to it), and the kind of
                    computing environment required to run the software. Think of the
                    features/requirements list as what you would give to someone asking
                    for a quick summary of the software. It is often just a logical
                    expansion of the mission statement. For example, the mission
                    statement might say:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>To create a full-text indexer and

            <div class="sect2" title="Development Status">

                <p>Visitors usually want to know how a project is doing. For new
                    projects, they want to know the gap between the project's promise and
                    current reality. For mature projects, they want to know how actively
                    it is maintained, how often it puts out new releases, how responsive
                    it is likely to be to bug reports, etc.</p>

                <p>There are a couple of different avenues for providing answers to
                    these questions. One is to have a development status page, listing
                    the project's near-term goals and needs (for example, it might be
                    looking for developers with a particular kind of expertise). The page
                    can also give a history of past releases, with feature lists, so
                    visitors can get an idea of how the project defines "progress", and
                    how quickly it makes progress according to that definition. Some
                    projects structure their development status page as a roadmap that
                    includes the future: past events are shown on the dates they actually
                    happened, future ones on the approximate dates the project hopes they
                    will happen.</p>

                <p>The other way&nbsp;â&nbsp;not mutually exclusive with the
                    first, and in fact probably best done in combination with
                    it&nbsp;â&nbsp;is to have various automatically-maintained
                    counters and indicators embedded in the projects's front page and/or
                    its developer landing page, showing various pieces of information
                    that, in the aggregate, give a sense of the project's development
                    status and progress. For example, an Announcements or News panel
                    showing recent news items, a Twitter or other microblog stream showing
                    notices that match the project's designated hashtags, a timeline of
                    recent releases, a panel showing recent activity in the bug tracker
                    (bugs filed, bugs responded to), another showing mailing list or
                    discussion forum activity, etc. Each such indicator should be a
                    gateway to further information of its type: for example, clicking on
                    the "recent bugs" panel should take one to the full bug tracker, or at
                    least to an expanded view into bug tracker activity.</p>

                <p>Really, there are two slightly different meanings of
                    "development status" being conflated here. One is the formal sense:
                    where does the project stand in relation to its stated goals, and how
                    fast is it making progress. The other is less formal but just as
                    useful: how active is this project? Is stuff going on? Are there
                    people here, getting things done? Often that latter notion is what a
                    visitor is most interested in. Whether or not a project met its most
                    recent milestone is sometimes not as interesting as the more
                    fundamental question of whether it has an active community of
                    developers around it.</p>

                <p>The two notions of development status are, of course, related,
                    and a well-presented project shows both kinds. The information can be
                    divided between the project's front page (show enough there to give an
                    overview of both types of development status) and a more
                    developer-oriented page.</p>

                <div class="sidebar" title="Example: Launchpad Status Indicators"><a

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>One site that does a pretty good job of showing
                        developer-oriented status indicators is Launchpad.net. Launchpad.net
                        is a bit unusual in that it is both a primary hosting platform for
                        some projects, and a secondary, packaging-oriented site for others (or
                        rather, for those others it is the primary site for the "project" of
                        getting that particular program packaged for the Ubuntu GNU/Linux
                        operating system, which Launchpad was specifically designed to
                        support). In either case, a project's landing page on Launchpad shows
                        a variety of automatically-maintained status indicators that quickly
                        give an idea of where the project stands. While simply imitating a
                        Launchpad page is probably not a good idea&nbsp;â&nbsp;your own
                        project should think carefully about what its best development status
                        indicators are&nbsp;â&nbsp;Launchpad project pages do provide
                        some good examples of the possibilities. Start from the top of a
                        project page there and scroll down: <a class="ulink" href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle"
                                                               target="_top">launchpad.net/drizzle</a>.
                        or <a class="ulink" href="https://launchpad.net/inkscape"
                              target="_top">launchpad.net/inkscape</a>, to pick two at random.</p></div>

                    <p>Don't be afraid of looking unready, and never give in to the
                        temptation to inflate or hype the development status. Everyone knows that
                        software evolves by stages; there's no shame in saying "This is alpha
                        software with known bugs. It runs, and works at least some of the
                        time, but use at your own risk." Such language won't scare away the
                        kinds of developers you need at that stage. As for users, one of the
                        worst things a project can do is attract users before the software is
                        ready for them. A reputation for instability or bugginess is very
                        hard to shake, once acquired. Conservativism pays off in the long
                        run; it's always better for the software to be
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> stable than the user expected than less, and
                        pleasant surprises produce the best kind of word-of-mouth.</p>

                        <p>The term <em class="firstterm">alpha</em> usually means a first
                            release, with which users can get real work done and which has all
                            the intended functionality, but which also has known bugs. The main
                            purpose of alpha software is to generate feedback, so the developers
                            know what to work on. The next stage, <em class="firstterm">beta</em>,
                            means the software has had all the serious bugs fixed, but has not
                            yet been tested enough to certify for production release. The purpose of beta
                            software is to either become the official release, assuming no bugs
                            are found, or provide detailed feedback to the developers so they
                            can reach the official release quickly. The difference between
                            alpha and beta is very much a matter of judgement.</p></div>

                <p>The software should be downloadable as source code in standard
                    formats. When a project is first getting started, binary (executable)
                    packages are not necessary, unless the software has such complicated
                    build requirements or dependencies that merely getting it to run would
                    be a lot of work for most people. (But if this is the case, the
                    project is going to have a hard time attracting developers
                    anyway!)</p>

                <p>The distribution mechanism should be as convenient, standard,
                    and low-overhead as possible. If you were trying to eradicate a
                    disease, you wouldn't distribute the medicine in such a way that it
                    requires a non-standard syringe size to administer. Likewise,
                    software should conform to standard build and installation methods;
                    the more it deviates from the standards, the more potential users and
                    developers will give up and go away confused.</p>

                <p>That sounds obvious, but many projects don't bother to
                    standardize their installation procedures until very late in the game,
                    telling themselves they can do it any time: <span class="emphasis"><em>"We'll sort all
                        that stuff out when the code is closer to being ready."</em></span>
                    What they don't realize is that by putting off the boring work of
                    finishing the build and installation procedures, they are actually
                    making the code take longer to get readyâbecause they
                    discourage developers who might otherwise have contributed to the
                    code, if only they could build and test it. Most insidiously, the
                    project won't even <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> it's
                    losing all those developers, because the process is an accumulation of
                    non-events: someone visits a web site, downloads the software, tries
                    to build it, fails, gives up and goes away. Who will ever know it
                    happened, except the person themselves? No one working on the project
                    will realize that someone's interest and good will have been silently
                    squandered.</p>

                <p>Boring work with a high payoff should always be done early, and
                    significantly lowering the project's barrier to entry through good
                    packaging brings a very high payoff.</p>

                <p>When you release a downloadable package, give it a unique
                    version number, so that people can compare any two releases and know
                    which supersedes the other. That way they can report bugs against a

                <p>The solution is to use a version control

                    this project is making an effort to give people what they need to

                <p>The same goes for the project's bug tracker. The importance of
                    a bug tracking system lies not only in its day-to-day usefulness to
                    developers, but in what it signifies for project observers. For many
                    people, an accessible bug database is one of the strongest signs that
                    a project should be taken seriously: the higher the number of bugs in
                    the database, the <span class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span> the project looks. This
                    might seem counterintuitive, but remember that the number of bug
                    reports filed really depends on three things: the absolute number of
                    actual software defects present in the code, the number of people
                    using the software,
                    and the convenience with which those people can report new bugs. Of
                    these three factors, the latter two are much more significant than the
                    first. Any software of sufficient size and complexity has an
                    essentially arbitrary number of bugs waiting to be discovered. The
                    real question is, how well will the project do at recording and
                    prioritizing those bugs? A project with a large and well-maintained
                    bug database (meaning bugs are responded to promptly, duplicate bugs
                    are unified, etc.) therefore makes a better impression than a project
                    with no bug database, or a nearly empty database.</p>

                <p>Of course, if your project is just getting started, then the bug
                    database will contain very few bugs, and there's not much you can do
                    about that. But if the status page emphasizes the project's youth,
                    and if people looking at the bug database can see that most filings
                    have taken place recently, they can extrapolate from that the project
                    still has a healthy <span class="emphasis"><em>rate</em></span> of filings, and they
                    will not be unduly alarmed by the low absolute number of bugs
                    recorded.<sup>[<a name="idp5518864" href="#ftn.idp5518864" class="footnote">16</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>Note that bug trackers are often used to track not only software
                    bugs, but enhancement requests, documentation changes, pending tasks,
                    and more. The details of running a bug tracker are covered in
                    <a class="xref" href="#bug-tracker" title="Bug Tracker">the section called âBug Trackerâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>, so I won't
                    go into them here. The important thing from a presentation point of
                    view is just to <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> a bug tracker, and to make
                    sure that fact is visible from the front page of the project.</p></div>

                <p>Visitors usually want to know how to reach the human beings

                    chat rooms, IRC channels (<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                                 title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                        <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a>),
                    and any other forums where others
                    involved with the software can be reached. Make it clear that you and
                    the other authors of the project are subscribed to these mailing
                    lists, so people see there's a way to give feedback that will reach
                    the developers. Your presence on the lists does not imply a
                    committment to answer all questions or implement all feature requests.
                    In the long run, probably only a fraction users will use the forums
                    anyway, but the others will be comforted to know that they
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> if they ever needed to.</p>

                <p>In the early stages of a project, there's no need to have
                    separate user and developer forums. It's much better to have everyone
                    involved with the software talking together, in one "room." Among
                    early adopters, the distinction between developer and user is often
                    fuzzy; to the extent that the distinction can be made, the ratio of
                    developers to users is usually much higher in the early days of the
                    project than later on. While you can't assume that every early
                    adopter is a programmer who wants to hack on the software, you can
                    assume that they are at least interested in following development
                    discussions and in getting a sense of the project's direction.</p>

                <p>As this chapter is only about getting a project started, it's
                    enough merely to say that these communications forums need to exist.

                    and how to set up such forums, the ways in which they might need
                    moderation or other management, and how to separate user forums from
                    developer forums, when the time comes, without creating an
                    unbridgeable gulf.</p></div>

                    technical as social: they explain how the developers interact with
                    each other and with the users, and ultimately how things get
                    done.</p>

                            development is usually done and how decisions are
                            madeâis the project a benevolent dictatorship, a

                    No pejorative sense is intended by "dictatorship", by the way. It's
                    perfectly okay to run a tyranny where one particular developer has
                    veto power over all changes. Many successful projects work this way.
                    The important thing is that the project come right out and say so. A
                    tyranny pretending to be a democracy will turn people off; a tyranny
                    that says it's a tyranny will do fine as long as the tyrant is
                    competent and trusted. (See <a class="xref" href="#forkability" title="Forkability">the section

                </div>
                <p>Documentation is essential. There needs to be
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> for people to read, even if it's
                    rudimentary and incomplete. This falls squarely into the "drudgery"
                    category referred to earlier, and is often the first area where a new
                    open source project falls down. Coming up with a mission statement
                    and feature list, choosing a license, summarizing development
                    statusâthese are all relatively small tasks, which can be
                    definitively completed and usually need not be revisited once done.
                    Documentation, on the other hand, is never really finished, which may
                    be one reason people sometimes delay starting it at all.</p>

                <p>The most insidious thing is that documentation's utility to
                    those writing it is the reverse of its utility to those who will read
                    it. The most important documentation for initial users is the basics:
                    how to quickly set up the software, an overview of how it works,
                    perhaps some guides to doing common tasks. Yet these are exactly the
                    things the <span class="emphasis"><em>writers</em></span> of the documentation know all
                    too wellâso well that it can be difficult for them to see
                    things from the reader's point of view, and to laboriously spell out
                    the steps that (to the writers) seem so obvious as to be unworthy of
                    mention.</p>

                <p>There's no magic solution to this problem. Someone just needs
                    to sit down and write the stuff, and then, most importantly,
                    incorporate feedback from readers. Use a simple, easy-to-edit format
                    such as HTML, plain text, Markdown, ReStructuredText, or some
                    variant of XMLâsomething that's convenient for lightweight,
                    quick improvements on the spur of the moment<sup>[<a name="idp5546032" href="#ftn.idp5546032"
                                                                         class="footnote">17</a>]</sup>. This is not
                    only to remove any
                    overhead that might impede the original writers from making
                    incremental improvements, but also for those who join the project
                    later and want to work on the documentation.</p>

                <p>One way to ensure basic initial documentation gets done is to
                    limit its scope in advance. That way, writing it at least won't feel
                    like an open-ended task. A good rule of thumb is that it should meet
                    the following minimal criteria:</p>

                            diagnostic test or simple command to confirm that
                            they've set things up correctly. Startup
                            documentation is in some ways more important than
                            actual usage documentation. The more effort someone has
                            invested in installing and getting started with the
                            software, the more persistent she'll be in figuring out
                            advanced functionality that's not well-documented.
                            When people abandon, they abandon early; therefore,
                            it's the earliest stages, like installation, that need
                            the most support.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Give one tutorial-style example of how to do a
                            common task. Obviously, many examples for many tasks
                            would be even better, but if time is limited, pick one
                            task and walk through it thoroughly. Once someone
                            sees that the software <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be
                            used for one thing, they'll start to explore what else
                            it can do on their ownâand, if you're lucky,
                            start filling in the documentation themselves. Which
                            brings us to the next point...</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Label the areas where the documentation is known
                            to be incomplete. By showing the readers that you are
                            aware of its deficiencies, you align yourself with
                            their point of view. Your empathy reassures them that
                            they don't face a struggle to convince the project of
                            what's important. These labels needn't represent
                            promises to fill in the gaps by any particular date
                            âit's equally legitimate to treat them as open
                            requests for volunteer help.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>The last point is of wider importance, actually, and can be
                    applied to the entire project, not just the documentation. An
                    accurate accounting of known deficiencies is the norm in the open
                    source world. You don't have to exaggerate the project's
                    shortcomings, just identify them scrupulously and dispassionately when
                    the context calls for it (whether in the documentation, in the bug
                    tracking database, or on a mailing list discussion). No one will
                    treat this as defeatism on the part of the project, nor as a
                    commitment to solve the problems by a certain date, unless the project
                    makes such a commitment explicitly. Since anyone who uses the
                    software will discover the deficiencies for themselves, it's much
                    better for them to be psychologically preparedâthen the
                    project will look like it has a solid knowledge of how it's
                    doing.</p>

                    <p>A <em class="firstterm">FAQ</em> ("Frequently Asked Questions"
                        document) can be one of the best investments a project makes in
                        terms of educational payoff. FAQs are highly tuned to the questions
                        users and developers actually askâas opposed to the questions
                        you might have <span class="emphasis"><em>expected</em></span> them to askâand
                        therefore, a well-maintained FAQ tends to give those who consult it
                        exactly what they're looking for. The FAQ is often the first place
                        users look when they encounter a problem, often even in preference
                        to the official manual, and it's probably the document in your
                        project most likely to be linked to from other sites.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, you cannot make the FAQ at the start of the
                        project. Good FAQs are not written, they are grown. They are by
                        definition reactive documents, evolving over time in response to
                        the questions people ask about the software. Since it's impossible
                        to correctly anticipate those questions, it is impossible to sit
                        down and write a useful FAQ from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, don't waste your time trying to. You may, however,
                        find it useful to set up a mostly blank FAQ template with just a few
                        questions and answers, so there will
                        be an obvious place for people to contribute questions and answers
                        after the project is under way. At this stage, the most important
                        property is not completeness, but <span class="emphasis"><em>convenience</em></span>:
                        if the FAQ is easy to
                        add to, people will add to it. (Proper FAQ maintenance is a
                        non-trivial and intriguing problem: see <a class="xref" href="#faq-manager">the section called

                    <p>Documentation should be available from two places: online
                        (directly from the web site), <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> in the
                        downloadable distribution of the software (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#packaging" title="Packaging">the section called âPackagingâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Chapter&nbsp;7,
    <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>). It needs to be
                        online, in browsable form, because people often read documentation
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> downloading software for the first time,
                        as a way of helping them decide whether to download at all. But it
                        should also accompany the software, on the principle that downloading
                        should supply (i.e., make locally accessible) everything one needs to
                        use the package.</p>

                    <p>For online documentation, make sure that there is a link that
                        brings up the <span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> documentation in one HTML
                        page (put a note like "monolithic" or "all-in-one" or "single large
                        page" next to the link, so people know that it might take a while to
                        load). This is useful because people often want to search for a
                        specific word or phrase across the entire documentation. Generally,
                        they already know what they're looking for; they just can't remember
                        what section it's in. For such people, nothing is more frustrating
                        than encountering one HTML page for the table of contents, then a
                        different page for the introduction, then a different page for
                        installation instructions, etc. When the pages are broken up like
                        that, their browser's search function is useless. The separate-page
                        style is useful for those who already know what section they need, or
                        who want to read the entire documentation from front to back in
                        sequence. But this is not necessarily the most common way
                        documentation is accessed. Often, someone who is basically
                        familiar with the software is coming back to search for a specific
                        word or phrase, and to fail to provide them with a single, searchable
                        document would only make their lives harder.</p></div>

                    <p>Developer documentation is written by programmers to help other
                        programmers
                        understand the code, so they can repair and extend it. This is
                        somewhat different from the <span class="emphasis"><em>developer guidelines</em></span>
                        discussed earlier, which are more social than technical. Developer
                        guidelines tell programmers how to get along with each other;
                        developer documentation tells them how to get along with the code
                        itself. The two are often packaged together in one document for
                        convenience (as with the <a class="ulink"
                                                    href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/"
                                                    target="_top">subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide</a> example
                        given
                        earlier), but they don't have to be.</p>

                    <p>Although developer documentation can be very helpful, there's no
                        reason to delay a release to do it. As long as the original authors
                        are available (and willing) to answer questions about the code, that's
                        enough to start with. In fact, having to answer the same questions
                        over and over is a common motivation for writing documentation. But
                        even before it's written, determined contributors will still manage to
                        find their way around the code. The force that drives people to spend
                        time learning a code base is that the code does something useful for
                        them. If people have faith in that, they will take the time to figure
                        things out; if they don't have that faith, no amount of developer
                        documentation will get or keep them.</p>

                    <p>So if you have time to write documentation for only one
                        audience, write it for users. All user documentation is, in effect,
                        developer documentation as well; any programmer who's going to work on
                        a piece of software will need to be familiar with how to use it too.
                        Later, when you see programmers asking the same questions over and
                        over, take the time to write up some separate documents just for
                        them.</p>

                    <p>Some projects use wikis for their initial documentation, or even
                        as their primary documentation. In my experience, this works best
                        if the wiki is actively maintained by a few people who agree on how
                        the documentation is to be organized and what sort of "voice" it
                        should have. See

                <p>If the project involves a graphical user interface, or if it
                    produces graphical or otherwise distinctive output, put some samples
                    up on the project web site. In the case of interface, this means
                    screenshots or, better yet, a brief (4 minutes or fewer) video with
                    subtitles or a narrator. For output, it might be screenshots or just
                    sample files to download. For web-based software, the gold standard
                    is a demo site, of course, assuming the software is amenable to
                    that.</p>

                <p>The main thing is to cater to people's desire for instant
                    gratification in the way they are most likely to expect. A single
                    screenshot or video can be more convincing than paragraphs of
                    descriptive text and mailing list chatter, because it is proof
                    that the software <span class="emphasis"><em>works</em></span>. The code may still be
                    buggy, it may be hard to install, it may be incompletely documented,
                    but image-based evidence shows people that if one puts in enough effort,
                    one can get it to run.</p>

                        duration <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> they click on it. This is in
                        keeping with the "principle of scaled presentation" mentioned
                        earlier: you want to make the decision to watch the video an easy
                        one, by removing all the risk. Visitors are more likely to click on
                        a link that says "Watch our 3 minute video" than on one that just
                        says "Watch our video", because in the former case they know what
                        they're getting into before they click&nbsp;â&nbsp;and they'll
                        watch it better, because they've mentally prepared the necessary
                        amount of commitment beforehand, and so won't tire mid-way
                        through.</p>

                    <p>As to where the four-minute limit came from: it's a scientific
                        fact, determined through many attempts by the same experimental
                        subject (who shall remain unnamed) to watch project videos. The
                        limit does not apply to tutorials or other instructional material,
                        of course; it's just for introductory videos.</p>

            <p>There are many other things you could put on the project web
                site, if you have the time, or if for one reason or another they are
                especially appropriate: a news page, a project history page, a related
                links page, a site-search feature, a donations link, etc. None of
                these are necessities at startup time, but keep them in mind for the
                future.</p>

                <p>Where on the Internet should you put the project's materials?</p>

                <p>A web site, obviously&nbsp;â&nbsp;but the full answer
                    is a little more complicated than that.</p>

                <p>Many projects distinguish between their primary public user-facing
                    web site&nbsp;â&nbsp;the one with the pretty pictures and the
                    "About" page and the gentle introductions and videos and guided tours
                    and all that stuff&nbsp;â&nbsp;and their developers' site, where
                    everything's grungy and full of closely-spaced text in monospace fonts
                    and impenetrable abbreviations.</p>

                <p>Well, I exaggerate. A bit. In any case, in the early stages of
                    your project it is not so important to distinguish between these two
                    audiences. Most of the interested visitors you get will be
                    developers, or at least people who are comfortable trying out new
                    code. Over time, you may find it makes sense to have a user-facing
                    site (of course, if your project is a code library, those "users"
                    might be other programmers) and a somewhat separate collaboration area
                    for those interested in participating in development. The
                    collaboration site would have the code repository, bug tracker,
                    development wiki, links to development mailing lists, etc. The two
                    sites should link to each other, and in particular it's important that
                    the user-facing site make it clear that the project is open source and
                    where the open source development activity can be
                    found.<sup>[<a name="idp5604224" href="#ftn.idp5604224" class="footnote">18</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>In the past, many projects set up the developer site and
                    infrastructure themselves. Over the last decade or so, however, most
                    open source projects&nbsp;â&nbsp;and almost all the new
                    ones&nbsp;â&nbsp;just use one of the "canned hosting" sites that
                    have sprung up to offer these services for free to open source
                    projects. By far the most popular such site, as of this writing in
                    mid-2013, is <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/" target="_top">GitHub.com</a>, and
                    if you don't have a strong preference about where to host, you should
                    probably just choose GitHub; many developers are already familiar with
                    it and have personal accounts there. <a class="xref" href="#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the

                <p>The terms "free software license" and "open source license"
                    are essentially synonymous, and I treat them so throughout this
                    book.</p>

                <p>Technically, the former term refers to licenses confirmed by
                    the Free Software Foundation as offering the "four freedoms"
                    necessary for free software (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"

                    latter term refers
                    to licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative as meeting the
                    Open Source Definition (<a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.org/osd" target="_top">opensource.org/osd</a>).
                    However, if you read the FSF's
                    definition of free software, and the OSI's definition of open source
                    software, it becomes obvious that the two definitions delineate the
                    same freedoms&nbsp;â&nbsp;not surprisingly, as <a class="xref" href="#free-vs-open-source"

                    some sense deliberate, result is that the two organizations have

            <p>There are a great many free software licenses to choose from.
                Most of them we needn't consider here, as they were written to satisfy
                the particular legal needs of some corporation or person, and wouldn't
                be appropriate for your project. We will restrict ourselves to just
                the most commonly used licenses; in most cases, you will want to

                    widely recognized free software license in the world today. This is
                    in itself a big advantage, since many potential users and contributors

                <p>Once you've chosen a license, you'll need to apply it to the
                    software.</p>

                <p>The first thing to do is state the license clearly on the
                    project's front page. You don't need to include the actual text of
                    the license there; just give its name and make it link to the full
                    license text on another page. That tells the public what license you
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>intend</em></span> the software to be released
                    underâbut it's not quite sufficient for legal purposes. The
                    other step is that the software itself should include the
                    license.</p>

                <p>The standard way to do this is to put the full license text in a
                    file called <code class="filename">COPYING</code> (or
                    <code class="filename">LICENSE</code>) included with the source code, and then
                    put a short notice in a comment at the top of each source file, naming
                    the copyright date, holder, and license, and saying where to find the
                    full text of the license.</p>

                <p>There are many variations on this pattern, so we'll look at just
                    one example here. The GNU GPL says to put a notice like this at the
                    top of each source file:</p><pre class="screen">Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;
</pre>
                <p>It does not say specifically that the copy of the license you
                    received along with the program is in the file
                    <code class="filename">COPYING</code> or <code class="filename">LICENSE</code>, but
                    that's where it's usually put. (You could change the above notice to
                    state that directly, but there's no real need to.)</p>

                <p>In general, the notice you put in each source file does not have
                    to look exactly like the one above, as long as it starts with the same
                    notice of copyright holder and date<sup>[<a name="idp5638832" href="#ftn.idp5638832"

                    license, and
                    makes clear where to view the full license terms. It's always best to
                    consult a lawyer, of course, if you can afford one.</p></div>

            <p>So far we've covered one-time tasks you do during project setup:
                picking a license, arranging the initial web site, etc. But the most
                important aspects of starting a new project are dynamic. Choosing a
                mailing list address is easy; ensuring that the list's conversations
                remain on-topic and productive is another matter entirely. For
                example, if the project is being opened up after years of closed,
                in-house development, its development processes will change, and you
                will have to prepare the existing developers for that change.</p>

            <p>The first steps are the hardest, because precedents and
                expectations for future conduct have not yet been set. Stability in a
                project does not come from formal policies, but from a shared,
                hard-to-pin-down collective wisdom that develops over time. There are
                often written rules as well, but they tend to be essentially a
                distillation of the intangible, ever-evolving agreements that really
                guide the project. The written policies do not define the project's
                culture so much as describe it, and even then only
                approximately.</p>

            <p>There are a few reasons why things work out this way. Growth
                and high turnover are not as damaging to the accumulation of social
                norms as one might think. As long as change does not happen
                <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> quickly, there is time for new arrivals to
                learn how things are done, and after they learn, they will help
                reinforce those ways themselves. Consider how children's songs
                survive for centuries. There are children today singing roughly the
                same rhymes as children did hundreds of years ago, even though there
                are no children alive now who were alive then. Younger children hear
                the songs sung by older ones, and when they are older, they in turn
                will sing them in front of other younger ones. The children are not
                engaging in a conscious program of transmission, of course, but the
                reason the songs survive is nonetheless that they are transmitted
                regularly and repeatedly. The time scale of free software projects
                may not be measured in centuries (we don't know yet), but the dynamics
                of transmission are much the same. The turnover rate is faster,
                however, and must be compensated for by a more active and deliberate
                transmission effort.</p>

            <p>This effort is aided by the fact that people generally show up
                expecting and looking for social norms. That's just how humans are
                built. In any group unified by a common endeavor, people who join
                instinctively search for behaviors that will mark them as part of the
                group. The goal of setting precedents early is to make those
                "in-group" behaviors be ones that are useful to the project; once
                established, they will be largely self-perpetuating.</p>

            <p>Following are some examples of specific things you can do to set
                good precedents. They're not meant as an exhaustive list, just as
                illustrations of the idea that setting a collaborative mood early
                helps a project tremendously. Physically, every developer may be
                working alone in a room by themselves, but you can do a lot to make
                them <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> like they're all working together in
                the same room. The more they feel this way, the more time they'll
                want to spend on the project. I chose these particular examples
                because they came up in the Subversion project (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/"
                                                                   target="_top">subversion.apache.org</a>),
                which I participated in and observed from its very beginning. But
                they're not unique to Subversion; situations like these will come up
                in most open source projects, and should be seen as opportunities to
                start things off on the right foot.</p>

                <p>Even after you've taken the project public, you and the other
                    founders will often find yourselves wanting to settle difficult
                    questions by private communications among an inner circle. This is
                    especially true in the early days of the project, when there are so
                    many important decisions to make, and, usually, few volunteers
                    qualified to make them. All the obvious disadvantages of public list
                    discussions will loom palpably in front of you: the delay inherent in
                    email conversations, the need to leave sufficient time for consensus
                    to form, the hassle of dealing with naive volunteers who think they
                    understand all the issues but actually don't (every project has these;
                    sometimes they're next year's star contributors, sometimes they stay
                    naive forever), the person who can't understand why you only want to
                    solve problem X when it's obviously a subset of larger problem Y, and
                    so on. The temptation to make decisions behind closed doors and
                    present them as <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">faits accomplis</em></span>,
                    or at
                    least as the firm recommendations of a united and influential voting
                    block, will be great indeed.</p>

                <p>Don't do it.</p>

                <p>As slow and cumbersome as public discussion can be, it's
                    almost always preferable in the long run. Making important decisions
                    in private is like spraying contributor repellant on your project. No
                    serious contributor would stick around for long in an environment where
                    a secret council makes all the big decisions. Furthermore, public
                    discussion has beneficial side effects that will last beyond whatever
                    ephemeral technical question was at issue:

                </p>

                            even if most people don't participate, many may be lurking
                            silently, gleaning information about the software.</p></li>

                            familiar with the software as you are. This is a skill that
                            requires practice, and you can't get that practice by talking
                            to people who already know what you know.</p></li>

                            retracing the same steps. See

                </p>

                <p>Finally, there is the possibility that someone on the list may
                    make a real contribution to the conversation, by coming up with an
                    idea you never anticipated. It's hard to say how likely this is; it
                    just depends on the complexity of the code and degree of
                    specialization required. But if anecdotal evidence may be permitted,
                    I would hazard that this is more likely than you might intuitively
                    expect. In the Subversion project, we (the founders) believed we
                    faced a deep and complex set of problems, which we had been thinking
                    about hard for several months, and we frankly doubted that anyone on
                    the newly created mailing list was likely to make a real contribution
                    to the discussion. So we took the lazy route and started batting some
                    technical ideas back and forth in private emails, until an observer of
                    the project<sup>[<a name="idp5659872" href="#ftn.idp5659872" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup> caught
                    wind of what
                    was happening and asked for the discussion to be moved to the public
                    list. Rolling our eyes a bit, we didâand were stunned by the
                    number of insightful comments and suggestions that quickly resulted.
                    In many cases people offered ideas that had never even occurred to us.
                    It turned out there were some <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> smart people
                    on that list; they'd just been waiting for the right bait. It's true
                    that the ensuing discussions took longer than they would have if we
                    had kept the conversation private, but they were so much more
                    productive that it was well worth the extra time.</p>

                <p>Without descending into hand-waving generalizations like "the
                    group is always smarter than the individual" (we've all met enough
                    groups to know better), it must be acknowledged that there are certain
                    activities at which groups excel. Massive peer review is one of them;
                    generating large numbers of ideas quickly is another. The quality of
                    the ideas depends on the quality of the thinking that went into them,
                    of course, but you won't know what kinds of thinkers are out there
                    until you stimulate them with a challenging problem.</p>

                <p>Naturally, there are some discussions that must be had
                    privately; throughout this book we'll see examples of those. But the
                    guiding principle should always be: <span class="emphasis"><em>If there's no reason for
                        it to be private, it should be public.</em></span></p>

                <p>Making this happen requires action. It's not enough merely to
                    ensure that all your own posts go to the public list. You also have
                    to nudge other people's unnecessarily private conversations to the
                    list too. If someone tries to start a private discussion with you and
                    there's no reason for it to be private, then it is incumbent on you to open
                    the appropriate meta-discussion immediately. Don't even comment on
                    the original topic until you've either successfully steered the
                    conversation to a public place, or ascertained that privacy really was
                    needed. If you do this consistently, people will catch on pretty
                    quickly and start to use the public forums by default.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Nip Rudeness in the Bud">
                <div class="titlepage">

                <p>From the very start of your project's public existence, you
                    should maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward rude or insulting
                    behavior in its forums. Zero-tolerance does not mean technical
                    enforcement per se. You don't have to remove people from the mailing
                    list when they flame another subscriber, or take away their commit
                    access because they made derogatory comments. (In theory, you might
                    eventually have to resort to such actions, but only after all other
                    avenues have failedâwhich, by definition, isn't the case at the
                    start of the project.) Zero-tolerance simply means never letting bad
                    behavior slide by unnoticed. For example, when someone posts a
                    technical comment mixed together with an <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
                        hominem</em></span> attack on some other developer in the project,
                    it is imperative that your response address the <span class="foreignphrase"><em
                            class="foreignphrase">ad
                        hominem</em></span> attack as a separate issue unto itself,
                    separate from the technical content.</p>

                <p>It is unfortunately very easy, and all too typical, for
                    constructive discussions to lapse into destructive flame wars.
                    People will say things in email that they would never say
                    face-to-face. The topics of discussion only amplify this effect: in
                    technical issues, people often feel there is a single right answer to
                    most questions, and that disagreement with that answer can only be
                    explained by ignorance or stupidity. It's a short distance from
                    calling someone's technical proposal stupid to calling the person
                    themselves stupid. In fact, it's often hard to tell where technical
                    debate leaves off and character attack begins, which is one reason why
                    drastic responses or punishments are not a good idea. Instead, when
                    you think you see it happening, make a post that stresses the
                    importance of keeping the discussion friendly, without accusing anyone
                    of being deliberately poisonous. Such "Nice Police" posts do have an
                    unfortunate tendency to sound like a kindergarten teacher lecturing a
                    class on good behavior:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>First, let's please cut down on the
                        (potentially) ad hominem comments; for example, calling J's
                        design for the security layer "naive and ignorant of the basic
                        principles of computer security." That may be true or it may
                        not, but in either case it's no way to have the discussion. J
                        made his proposal in good faith. If it has deficiencies, point
                        them out, and we'll fix them or get a new design. I'm sure M
                        meant no personal insult to J, but the phrasing was unfortunate,
                        and we try to keep things constructive around here.
                    </em></span></p>

                        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Now, on to the proposal. I think M was right
                            in saying that...</em></span></p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>As stilted as such responses sound, they have a noticeable
                    effect. If you consistently call out bad behavior, but don't demand
                    an apology or acknowledgment from the offending party, then you leave
                    people free to cool down and show their better side by behaving more
                    decorously next timeâand they will.</p>

                <p>One of the secrets of
                    doing this successfully is to never make the meta-discussion the main
                    topic. It should always be an aside, a brief preface to the main
                    portion of your response. Point out in passing that "we don't do
                    things that way around here," but then move on to the real content, so
                    that you're giving people something on-topic to respond to. If
                    someone protests that they didn't deserve your rebuke, simply refuse
                    to be drawn into an argument about it. Either don't respond (if you
                    think they're just letting off steam and don't require a response), or
                    say you're sorry if you overreacted and that it's hard to detect
                    nuance in email, then get back to the main topic. Never, ever insist
                    on an acknowledgment, whether public or private, from someone that
                    they behaved inappropriately. If they choose of their own volition to
                    post an apology, that's great, but demanding that they do so will only
                    cause resentment.</p>

                <p>The overall goal is to make good etiquette be seen as one of the
                    "in-group" behaviors. This helps the project, because developers can
                    be driven away (even from projects they like and want to support) by
                    flame wars. You may not even know that they were driven away; someone
                    might lurk on the mailing list, see that it takes a thick skin to
                    participate in the project, and decide against getting involved at
                    all. Keeping forums friendly is a long-term survival strategy, and
                    it's easier to do when the project is still small. Once it's part of
                    the culture, you won't have to be the only person promoting it. It
                    will be maintained by everyone.</p></div>

                    rather than on reviewing code that's been around for a while. First,
                    it just works better socially: when someone reviews your change, she
                    is interacting with work you did recently. That means if she comments
                    on it right away, you will be maximally interested in hearing what she
                    has to say; six months later, you might not feel as motivated to
                    engage, and in any case might not remember the change very well.
                    Second, looking at what changes in a codebase is a gateway to looking
                    at the rest of the code anyway&nbsp;â&nbsp;reviewing a change
                    often causes one to look at the surrounding code, at the affected
                    callers and callees elsewhere, at related module interfaces,
                    etc.<sup>[<a name="idp5678784" href="#ftn.idp5678784" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>Commit review thus serves several purposes simultaneously. It's
                    the most obvious example of peer review in the open source world, and
                    directly helps to maintain software quality. Every bug that ships in
                    a piece of software got there by being committed and not detected;
                    therefore, the more eyes watch commits, the fewer bugs will ship. But
                    commit review also serves an indirect purpose: it confirms to people
                    that what they do matters, because one obviously wouldn't take time to
                    review a commit unless one cared about its effect. People do their
                    best work when they know that others will take the time to evaluate
                    it.</p>

                <p>Reviews should be public. Even on occasions when I have been
                    sitting in the same physical room with another developer, and one of
                    us has made a commit, we take care not to do the review verbally in
                    the room, but to send it to the appropriate online review forum
                    instead. Everyone benefits from seeing the review happen. People
                    follow the commentary and sometimes find flaws in it; even when they
                    don't, it still reminds them that review is an expected, regular
                    activity, like washing the dishes or mowing the lawn.</p>

                <p>Some technical infrastructure is required to do change-by-change
                    review effectively. In particular, setting up commit notifications is
                    extremely useful. The effect of commit notifications is that every
                    time someone commits a change to the central repository, an email or
                    other subscribable notification goes out showing the log message and
                    diffs (unless the diff is too large; see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-diff"><em
                            class="firstterm">diff</em></a>, in <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary"

                        âVersion Control Vocabularyâ</a>).
                    The review itself might take place on a mailing list, or in a review
                    tool such as Gerrit or the GitHub "pull request" interface. See <a class="xref"

                    <div class="titlepage">

                    </div>
                    <p>In the Subversion project, we did not at first make a regular
                        practice of code review. There was no guarantee that every commit
                        would be reviewed, though one might sometimes look over a change if
                        one were particularly interested in that area of the code. Bugs
                        slipped in that really could and should have been caught. A developer
                        named Greg Stein, who knew the value of code review from past work,
                        decided that he was going to set an example by reviewing every line of
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>every single commit</em></span> that went into the code
                        repository. Each commit anyone made was soon followed by an email to
                        the developer's list from Greg, dissecting the commit, analyzing
                        possible problems, and occasionally praising a clever bit of code. Right
                        away, he was catching bugs and non-optimal coding practices that would
                        otherwise have slipped by without ever being noticed. Pointedly, he
                        never complained about being the only person reviewing every commit,
                        even though it took a fair amount of his time, but he did sing the
                        praises of code review whenever he had the chance. Pretty soon, other
                        people, myself included, started reviewing commits regularly too.</p>

                    <p>What was our motivation? It wasn't that Greg had consciously shamed
                        us into it. But he had proven that reviewing code was a valuable way
                        to spend time, and that one could contribute as much to the project by
                        reviewing others' changes as by writing new code. Once he
                        demonstrated that, it became expected behavior, to the point where any
                        commit that didn't get some reaction would cause the committer to
                        worry, and even ask on the list whether anyone had had a chance to
                        review it yet. Later, Greg got a job that didn't leave him as much
                        time for Subversion, and had to stop doing regular reviews. But by
                        then, the habit was so ingrained for the rest of us as to seem that it
                        had been going on since time immemorial.</p></div>
                <p>Start doing reviews from very first commit. The sorts of
                    problems that are easiest to catch by reviewing diffs are security
                    vulnerabilities, memory leaks, insufficient comments or API
                    documentation, off-by-one errors, caller/callee discipline mismatches,
                    and other problems that require a minimum of surrounding context to
                    spot. However, even larger-scale issues such as failure to abstract
                    repeated patterns to a single location become spottable after one has
                    been doing reviews regularly, because the memory of past diffs informs
                    the review of present diffs.</p>

                <p>Don't worry that you might not find anything to comment on, or
                    that you don't know enough about every area of the code. There will
                    usually be something to say about almost every commit; even where you
                    don't find anything to question, you may find something to praise.
                    The important thing is to make it clear to every committer that what
                    they do is seen and understood, that attention is being paid. Of
                    course, code review does not absolve programmers of the responsibility
                    to review and test their changes before committing; no one should
                    depend on code review to catch things she ought to have caught on her
                    own.</p></div>

                <p>Start your project out in the open from the very first day. The
                    longer a project is run in a closed source manner, the harder it is to
                    open source later.<sup>[<a name="idp5692816" href="#ftn.idp5692816" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup>
                </p>

                <p>Being open source from the start doesn't mean your developers
                    must immediately take on the extra responsibilities of community
                    management. People often think that "open source" means "strangers
                    distracting us with questions", but that's
                    optional&nbsp;â&nbsp;it's something you might do down the road,
                    if and when it makes sense for your project. It's under your control.
                    There are still major advantages to be had by running the project out
                    in open, publicly-visible forums from the beginning. Conversely, the
                    longer the project is run closed-source, the more difficult it will be
                    to open up later.</p>

                <p>I think there's one underlying cause for this:</p>

                <p>At each step in a project, programmers face a choice: to do that
                    step in a manner compatible with a hypothetical future open-sourcing,
                    or do it in a manner incompatible with open-sourcing. And every time
                    they choose the latter, the project gets just a little bit harder to
                    open source.</p>

                <p>The crucial thing is, they can't help choosing the latter
                    occasionally&nbsp;â&nbsp;all the pressures of development propel
                    them that way. It's very difficult to give a future event the same
                    present-day weight as, say, fixing the incoming bugs reported by the
                    testers, or finishing that feature the customer just added to the
                    spec. Also, programmers struggling to stay on budget will inevitably
                    cut corners here and there (in Ward Cunningham's phrase, they will
                    incur "<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" target="_top">technical
                        debt</a>"), with the intention of cleaning it up
                    later.</p>

                <p>Thus, when it's time to open source, you'll suddenly find there
                    are things like:</p>

                <p>The problem isn't just the work of doing the cleanups; it's the
                    extra decision-making they sometimes require. For example, if
                    sensitive material was checked into the code repository in the past,
                    your team now faces a choice between cleaning it out of the historical
                    revisions entirely, so you can open source the entire (sanitized)
                    history, or just cleaning up the latest revision and open-sourcing
                    from that (sometimes called a "top-skim"). Neither method is wrong or
                    right&nbsp;â&nbsp;and that's the problem: now you've got one
                    more discussion to have and one more decision to make. In some
                    projects, that decision gets made and reversed several times before
                    the final release. The thrashing itself is part of the cost.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The other problem with opening up a developed code base is that
                        it creates a needlessly large exposure event. Whatever issues there
                        may be in the code (modularity corner-cutting, security
                        vulnerabilities, etc), they are all exposed to public scrutiny at
                        once&nbsp;â&nbsp;the open-sourcing event becomes an opportunity
                        for the technical blogosphere to pounce on the code and see what they
                        can find.</p>

                    <p>Contrast that with the scenario where development was done in
                        the open from the beginning: code changes come in one at a time, so
                        problems are handled as they come up (and are often caught sooner,
                        since there are more eyeballs on the code). Because changes reach the
                        public at a low, continuous rate of exposure, no one blames your
                        development team for the occasional corner-cutting or flawed code
                        checkin. Everyone's been there, after all; these tradeoffs are
                        inevitable in real-world development. As long as the technical debt
                        is properly recorded in "FIXME" comments and bug reports, and any
                        security issues are addressed promptly, it's fine. Yet if those same
                        issues were to appear suddenly all at once, unsympathetic observers
                        may jump on the aggregate exposure in a way they never would have if
                        the issues had come up piecemeal in the normal course of
                        development.</p>

                <p>The good news is that these are all unforced errors. A project
                    incurs little extra cost by avoiding them in the simplest way
                    possible: by running in the open from Day One.</p>

                <p>"In the open" means the following things are publicly
                    accessible, in standard formats, from the first day of the project:
                    the code repository, bug tracker, design documents, user
                    documentation, wiki, and developer discussion forums. It also means
                    the code and documentation are placed under an open source license, of
                    course. It also means your team's day-to-day work takes place in the
                    publicly visible area.</p>

                <p>"In the open" does not have to mean: allowing strangers to check
                    code into your repository (they're free to copy it into their own
                    repository, if they want, and work with it there); allowing anyone to
                    file bug reports in your tracker (you're free to choose your own QA
                    process, and if allowing reports from strangers doesn't help you, you
                    don't have to do it); reading and responding to every bug report
                    filed, even if you do allow strangers to file; responding to every
                    question people ask in the forums (even if you moderate them through);
                    reviewing every patch or suggestion posted, when doing so may cost
                    valuable development time; etc.</p>

                <p>One way to think of it is that you're open sourcing your code,
                    not your time. One of those resources is infinitely replicable, the
                    other is not. You'll have to determine the point at which engaging
                    with outside users and developers makes sense for your project. In
                    the long run it usually does, and most of this book is about how to do
                    it effectively. But it's still under your control. Developing in the
                    open does not change this, it just ensures that everything done in the
                    project is, by definition, done in a way that's compatible with being
                    open source.</p></div>

            <p>As per <a class="xref" href="#be-open-from-day-one" title="Be Open From Day One">the section called âBe
                Open From Day Oneâ</a>, it's best to
                avoid being in the situation of opening up a closed project in the
                first place; just start the project in the open if you can. But if
                it's too late for that, and you find yourself opening up an existing
                project that already has active developers accustomed to working in a
                closed-source environment, there are certain common issues that tend
                to arise. You can save a lot of time and trouble if you are prepared
                for them.</p>

            <p>Some of these issues are essentially
                mechanical&nbsp;â&nbsp;indeed, <a class="ulink" href="be-open-from-day-one" target="_top">be-open-from-day-one</a>
                can serve as a checklist of sorts. For
                example, if your code depends on proprietary libraries that are not
                part of the standard distribution of your target operating system(s),
                you will need to find open source replacements; if there is
                confidential content&nbsp;â&nbsp;e.g., unpublishable comments,
                passwords or site-specific configuration information that cannot
                easily be changed, confidential data belonging to third parties,
                etc&nbsp;â&nbsp;in the project's version control history, then
                you may have to release a "top-skim" version, that is, restart the
                version history afresh from the current version as of the moment you
                open source the code; and so on.</p>

            <p>But there can be social and managerial issues too, and they are
                often more significant in the long run than the mere mechanical
                concerns. You will need to make sure everyone on the development team
                understands that a big change is comingâand make sure that you
                understand how it's going to feel from their point of view.</p>

            <p>Try to imagine how the situation looks to them: formerly, all
                code and design decisions were made with a group of other programmers
                who knew the software more or less equally well, who all received the
                same pressures from the same management, and who all know each others'
                strengths and weaknesses. Now you're asking them to expose their code
                to the scrutiny of random strangers, who will form judgements based
                only on the code, with no awareness of what business pressures may
                have forced certain decisions. These strangers will ask lots of
                questions, questions that jolt the existing developers into realizing
                that the documentation they slaved so hard over is
                <span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> inadequate (this is inevitable). To top it
                all off, the newcomers are unknown, faceless entities. If one of your
                developers already feels insecure about his skills, imagine how that
                will be exacerbated when newcomers point out flaws in code he wrote,
                and worse, do so in front of his colleagues. Unless you have a team
                of perfect coders, this is unavoidableâin fact, it will probably
                happen to all of them at first. This is not because they're bad
                programmers; it's just that any program above a certain size has bugs,
                and peer review will spot some of those bugs (see
                <a class="xref" href="#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the section called
                    âPractice Conspicuous Code Reviewâ</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>). At the same time, the newcomers
                themselves won't be subject to much peer review at first, since they
                can't contribute code until they're more familiar with the project.
                To your developers, it may feel like all the criticism is incoming,
                never outgoing. Thus, there is the danger of a siege mentality taking
                hold among the old hands.</p>

            <p>The best way to prevent this is to warn everyone about what's
                coming, explain it, tell them that the initial discomfort is perfectly
                normal, and reassure them that it's going to get better. Some of
                these warnings should take place privately, before the project is
                opened. But you may also find it helpful to remind people on the
                public lists that this is a new way of development for the project,
                and that it will take some time to adjust. The very best thing you
                can do is lead by example. If you don't see your developers answering
                enough newbie questions, then just telling them to answer more isn't
                going to help. They may not have a good sense of what warrants a
                response and what doesn't yet, or it could be that they don't have a
                feel for how to prioritize coding work against the new burden of
                external communications. The way to get them to participate is to
                participate yourself. Be on the public mailing lists, and make sure
                to answer some questions there. When you don't have the
                expertise to field a question, then visibly hand it off to a developer
                who doesâand watch to make sure he follows up with an answer,
                or at least a response. It will naturally be tempting for the
                longtime developers to lapse into private discussions, since that's
                what they're used to. Make sure you're subscribed to the internal
                mailing lists on which this might happen, so you can ask that such
                discussions be moved to the public lists right away.</p>

            <p>If you expect the newly-public project to start involving
                developers who are not paid directly for their
                work&nbsp;â&nbsp;and there are usually at least a few such
                developers on most successful open source
                projects&nbsp;â&nbsp;see <a class="xref" href="#money" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Money">Chapter&nbsp;5,

            <p>Once the project is presentableânot perfect, just
                presentableâyou're ready to announce it to the world.</p>

            <p>This is a simpler process than you might expect. There are two kinds
                of forums for making announcements: generic forums that display a
                constant stream of new project announcements, and topic-specific
                forums where your project would be appropriate news.</p>

            <p>The most useful generic place is probably <a class="ulink" href="http://freecode.com/" target="_top">freecode.com</a>&nbsp;â&nbsp;just
                click on the
                <span class="guimenuitem">Submit new project</span> link in the top
                navigation bar. Freecode's list of recent new projects is embedded on
                the front page of the popular <a class="ulink" href="http://slashdot.org/"
                                                 target="_top">Slashdot.org</a>, which means someone interested is
                likely to
                notice it and help spread the news by word of mouth. (Note that
                Freecode was known as Freshmeat.net until it was renamed in Oct 2011.)
                You might also want to register your project at <a class="ulink" href="http://OhLoh.net/" target="_top">OhLoh.net</a>,
                which is the closest thing
                there is to an integrated global database of free software projects
                and their contributors. (Some projects also successfully climb the
                word-of-mouth / upvote tree to the point where they are featured on
                the front page of <a class="ulink" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_top">news.ycombinator.com</a>,
                one of the subreddit forums related to
                <a class="ulink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/" target="_top">reddit.com/r/technology</a>,
                or some similarly popular public
                page. While it's good news for your project if you can get mentioned
                in a place like that, I hesitate to contribute to the marketing arms
                race by suggesting any concrete steps to accomplish this. Use your
                judgement and try not to spam.)</p>

            <p>The topic-specific forums are probably where you'll get the most
                interest. Think about mailing lists or web forums where an
                announcement of your project would be on-topic and of
                interest&nbsp;â&nbsp;you might already be a member of some of
                them&nbsp;â&nbsp;and post there. Be careful to make exactly
                <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> post per forum, and to direct people to your
                project's own discussion areas for follow-up discussion (when posting
                by email, you can do this by setting the
                <code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> header). Your announcement should
                be short and get right to the point, and the Subject line should make
                it clear that it is an announcement of a new project:</p><pre class="screen">To: discuss@some.forum.about.search.indexers

<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>
                for advice on announcing
                subsequent releases and other project events.)</p>

            <p>There is an ongoing debate in the free software world about
                whether it is necessary to begin with running code, or whether a
                project can benefit from being announced even during the
                design/discussion stage. I used to think starting with running code
                was crucial, that it was what separated successful projects from toys,
                and that serious developers would only be attracted to software that
                already does something concrete.</p>

            <p>This turned out not to be the case. In the Subversion project,
                we started with a design document, a core of interested and
                well-connected developers, a lot of fanfare, and
                <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> running code at all. To my complete surprise,
                the project acquired active participants right from the beginning, and
                by the time we did have something running, there were quite a few
                volunteer developers already deeply involved. Subversion is not the
                only example; the Mozilla project was also launched without running
                code, and is now a successful and popular web browser.</p>

            <p>On the evidence of this and other examples, I have to back away
                from the assertion that running code is absolutely necessary for
                launching a project. Running code is still the best foundation for
                success, and a good rule of thumb would be to wait until you have it
                before announcing your project<sup>[<a name="idp5741392" href="#ftn.idp5741392" class="footnote">24</a>]</sup>.
                However, there may be circumstances where
                announcing earlier makes sense. I do think that at least a
                well-developed design document, or else some sort of code framework,
                is necessaryâof course it may be revised based on public
                feedback, but there has to be something concrete, something more
                tangible than just good intentions, for people to sink their teeth
                into.</p>

            <p>Whenever you announce, don't expect a horde of volunteers to
                join the project immediately afterward. Usually, the result of
                announcing is that you get a few casual inquiries, a few more people
                join your mailing lists, and aside from that, everything continues
                pretty much as before. But over time, you will notice a gradual
                increase in participation from both new code contributors and users.
                Announcement is merely the planting of a seed. It can take a long
                time for the news to spread. If the project consistently rewards
                those who get involved, the news <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> spread,
                though, because people want to share when they've found something
                good. If all goes well, the dynamics of exponential communications
                networks will slowly transform the project into a complex community,
                where you don't necessarily know everyone's name and can no longer
                follow every single conversation. The next chapters are about working
                in that environment.</p></div>

                are actually
                some minor differences between the sets of approved licenses, but
                they are not significant for our purposes&nbsp;â&nbsp;or
                indeed for most practical purposes. In some cases, one or the other
                organization has simply not gotten around to considering a given
                license, usually a license that is not widely-used anyway. And
                apparently (so I'm told) there historically was a license that at
                least one of the organizations, and possibly both, agreed fit one
                definition but not the other. Whenever I try to get the details on
                this, though, I seem to get a different answer as to what that
                license was, except that the license named is always one that was
                not many people used anyway. So today, for any license you are
                likely to be using, the terms "OSI-approved" and "FSF-approved" can

            <p>Free software projects rely on technologies that support the
                selective capture and integration of information. The more skilled
                you are at using these technologies, and at persuading others to use
                them, the more successful your project will be.</p>

            <p>This only becomes
                more true as the project grows. Good information management is what
                prevents open source projects from collapsing under the weight of
                Brooks' Law<sup>[<a name="idp6036752" href="#ftn.idp6036752" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup>,
                which states that adding manpower to a late software project makes it
                later. Fred Brooks observed that the complexity of communications in
                a project
                increases as the <span class="emphasis"><em>square</em></span> of the number of
                participants. When only a few people are involved, everyone can easily
                talk to everyone else, but when hundreds of people are involved, it is
                no longer possible for each person to remain constantly aware of what
                everyone else is doing. If good free software project management is
                about making everyone feel like they're all working together in the
                same room, the obvious question is: what happens when everyone in a
                crowded room tries to talk at once?</p>

            <p>This problem is not new. In non-metaphorical crowded rooms, the
                solution is <em class="firstterm">parliamentary procedure</em>: formal
                guidelines for how to have real-time discussions in large groups, how
                to make sure important dissents are not lost in floods of "me-too"
                comments, how to form subcommittees, how to recognize and record when
                decisions
                are made, etc. An important part of parliamentary procedure is
                specifying how the group interacts with its information management
                system. Some remarks are made "for the record", others are not. The
                record itself is subject to direct manipulation, and is understood to
                be not a literal transcript of what occurred, but a representation of
                what the group is willing to <span class="emphasis"><em>agree</em></span> occurred. The
                record is not monolithic, but takes different forms for different
                purposes. It comprises the minutes of individual meetings, the
                complete collection of all minutes of all meetings, summaries, agendas
                and their annotations, committee reports, reports from correspondents
                not present, lists of action items, etc.</p>

            <p>Because the Internet is not really a room, we don't have to
                worry about replicating those parts of parliamentary procedure that
                keep some people quiet while others are speaking. But when it comes
                to information management techniques, well-run open source projects
                are parliamentary procedure on steroids. Since almost all
                communication in open source projects happens in writing, elaborate
                systems have evolved for routing and labeling data appropriately, for
                minimizing repetitions so as to avoid spurious divergences, for
                storing and retrieving data, for correcting bad or obsolete
                information, and for associating disparate bits of information with
                each other as new connections are observed. Active participants in
                open source projects internalize many of these techniques, and will
                often perform complex manual tasks to ensure that information is
                routed correctly. But the whole endeavor ultimately depends on
                sophisticated software support. As much as possible, the
                communications media themselves should do the routing, labeling, and
                recording, and should make the information available to humans in the
                most convenient way possible. In practice, of course, humans will
                still need to intervene at many points in the process, and it's
                important that the software make such interventions convenient too.
                But in general, if the humans take care to label and route information
                accurately on its first entry into the system, then the software
                should be configured to make as much use of that metadata as
                possible.</p>

            <p>The advice in this chapter is intensely practical, based on
                experiences with specific software and usage patterns. But the point
                is not just to teach a particular collection of techniques. It is
                also to demonstrate, by means of many small examples, the overall
                attitude that will best encourage good information management in your
                project. This attitude will involve a combination of technical skills
                and people skills. The technical skills are essential because
                information management software always requires configuration, plus a
                certain amount of ongoing maintenance and tweaking as new needs arise
                (for example, see the discussion of how to handle project growth in
                <a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">the section called
                    âPre-Filtering the Bug Trackerâ</a><span> later in
this chapter</span>). The people skills are necessary
                because the human community also requires maintenance: it's not always
                immediately obvious how to use these tools to full advantage, and in
                some cases projects have conflicting conventions (for example, see the
                discussion of setting <code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> headers on
                outgoing mailing list posts, in <a class="xref" href="#message-forums"
                                                   title="Mailing Lists / Message Forums">the section called âMailing
                    Lists / Message Forumsâ</a>).
                Everyone involved with the project will need to be encouraged, at the
                right times and in the right ways, to do their part to keep the
                project's information well organized. The more involved the
                contributor, the more complex and specialized the techniques she can
                be expected to learn.</p>

            <p>Information management has no cut-and-dried solution. There are
                too many variables. You may finally get everything configured just
                the way you want it, and have most of the community participating, but
                then project growth will make some of those practices unscalable. Or
                project growth may stabilize, and the developer and user communities
                settle into a comfortable relationship with the technical
                infrastructure, but then someone will come along and invent a whole
                new information management service, and pretty soon newcomers will be
                asking why your project doesn't use itâfor example, this
                happened to a lot of free software projects that predate the invention
                of the wiki (see <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a>),
                and more recently has been
                happening to projects whose workflows were developed before the rise
                of GitHub PRs (see <a class="xref" href="#pull-requests" title="Pull requests">the section called âPull
                    requestsâ</a>) as the canonical
                way to package proposed contributions. Many infrastructure questions
                are matters of judgement, involving tradeoffs between the convenience
                of those producing information and the convenience of those consuming
                it, or between the time required to configure information management
                software and the benefit it brings to the project.</p>

            <p>Beware of the temptation to over-automate, that is, to automate
                things that really require human attention. Technical infrastructure
                is important, but what makes a free software project work is
                careâand intelligent expression of that careâby the humans
                involved. The technical infrastructure is mainly about giving humans
                easy ways to apply care.</p></div>

            <p>Each tool in this set addresses a distinct need, but their functions
                are also interrelated, and the tools must be made to work together.
                Below we will examine how they can do so, and more importantly, how to
                get people to use them.</p>

            <p>You may be able to avoid a lot of the headache of choosing and
                configuring many of these tools by using a <em class="firstterm">canned
                    hosting</em> site: an online service that offers prepackaged,
                templatized web services with some or all of the collaboration tools
                needed to run a free software project. See
                <a class="xref" href="#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the section called âCanned
                    Hostingâ</a><span> later
in this chapter</span> for a discussion of the advantages and
                disadvantages of canned hosting.</p></div>
        <div class="sect1" title="Web Site">
            <div class="titlepage">

            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>possv2 24 March 2013: If you're reading this note, then
                you've encountered this chapter while it's undergoing substantial
                revision; see <a class="ulink" href="http://producingoss.com/v2.html" target="_top">producingoss.com/v2.html</a>
                for details.</em></span></p>

            <p>For our purposes, <span class="emphasis"><em>the web site</em></span> means web
                pages devoted to helping people participate in the project as
                developers, documenters, etc. Note that this is different from the
                main user-facing web site. In many projects, users have different
                needs and often (statistically speaking) a different mentality from
                the developers. The kinds of web pages most helpful to users are not
                necessarily the same as those helpful for
                developers&nbsp;â&nbsp;don't try to make a "one size fits all"
                web site just to save some writing and maintenance effort: you'll end
                up with a site that is not quite right for either audience.</p>

            <p>The two types of sites should cross-link, of course, and in
                particular it's important that the user-oriented site have, tucked a
                way in a corner somewhere, a clear link to the developers' site, since
                most new developers will start out at the user-facing pages and look
                for a path from there to the developers' area.</p>

            <p>An example may make this clearer. As of this writing in
                November 2013, the office suite LibreOffice has its main user-oriented
                web site at <a class="ulink" href="https://libreoffice.org/" target="_top">libreoffice.org</a>, as you'd
                expect. If you were a user wanting
                to download and install LibreOffice, you'd start there, go straight to
                the "Download" link, and so on. But if you were a developer looking
                to (say) fix a bug in LibreOffice, you might
                <span class="emphasis"><em>start</em></span> at <a class="ulink" href="https://libreoffice.org/"
                                                                   target="_top">libreoffice.org</a>, but you'd be
                looking for a link that says
                something like "Developers", or "Development", or "Get
                Involved"&nbsp;â&nbsp;in other words, you'd be looking for the
                gateway to the development area.</p>

            <p>In the case of LibreOffice, as with some other large projects,
                they actually have a couple of different gateways. There's one link
                that says <a class="ulink" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/get-involved/" target="_top">"Get&nbsp;Involved"</a>,
                and another that says <a class="ulink" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/developers/" target="_top">"Developers"</a>.
                The "Get Involved" page is aimed at the broadest possible range of
                potential contributors: developers, yes, but also documenters,
                quality-assurance testers, marketing volunteers, web infrastructure
                volunteers, financial or in-kind donors, interface designers, support
                forum volunteers, etc. This frees up the "Developers" page to target
                the rather narrower audience of programmers who want to get involved
                in improving the LibreOffice code. The set of links and short
                descriptions provided on both pages is admirably clear and concise:
                you can tell immediately from looking whether you're in the right
                place for what you want do, and if so what the next thing to click on
                is. The "Development" page gives some information about where to find
                the code, how to contact the other developers, how to file bugs, and
                things like that, but most importantly it points to what most seasoned
                open source contributors would instantly recognize as the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> gateway to actively-maintained development
                information: the development wiki at <a class="ulink"
                                                        href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development"
                                                        target="_top">wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development</a>.</p>

            <p>This division into two contributor-facing gateways, one for all
                kinds of contributions and another for coders specifically, is
                probably right for a large, multi-faceted project like LibreOffice.
                You'll have to use your judgement as to whether that kind of
                subdivision is appropriate for your project; at least at the
                beginning, it probably isn't. It's better to start with one unified
                contributor gateway, aimed at all the types of contributors you
                expect, and if that page ever gets large enough or complex enough to
                feel unwieldy&nbsp;â&nbsp;listen carefully for complaints about
                it, since you and other long-time participants will be naturally
                desensitized to weaknesses in introductory
                pages!&nbsp;â&nbsp;then you can divide it up however seems
                best.</p>

            <p>From a technical point of view there is not much to say about
                setting up the project web site. Configuring a web server and writing
                web pages are fairly simple tasks, and most of the important things to
                say about layout and arrangement were covered in the previous chapter.
                The web site's main function is to present a clear and welcoming
                overview of the project, and to bind together the other tools (the
                version control system, bug tracker, etc.). If you don't have the
                expertise to set up a web server yourself, it's usually not hard to
                find someone who does and is willing to help out. Nonetheless, to
                save time and effort, people often prefer to use one of the canned
                hosting sites.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Canned Hosting">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting"></a>Canned Hosting</h3></div>

                </div>
                <p>A <em class="firstterm">canned hosting</em> site is an online
                    service that offers some or all of the online collaboration tools
                    needed to run a free software project. At a minimal, a canned hosting
                    site offers public version control repositories and bug tracking; most
                    also offer wiki space, many offer mailing list hosting too, and some
                    offer continuous integration testing and other
                    services.<sup>[<a name="idp6125200" href="#ftn.idp6125200" class="footnote">26</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>There are two main advantages to using a canned site. The first
                    is server capacity and bandwidth: their servers are hefty boxes
                    sitting on really fat pipes. No matter how successful your project
                    gets, you're not going to run out of disk space or swamp the network
                    connection. The second advantage is simplicity. They have already
                    chosen a bug tracker, a version control system, perhaps discussion
                    forum software, and everything else you need to run a project.
                    They've configured the tools, arranged single-sign-on authentication
                    where appropriate, are taking care of backups for all the data stored
                    in the tools, etc. You don't need to make many decisions. All you
                    have to do is fill in a registration form, press a button, and
                    suddenly you've got a project development web site.</p>

                <p>These are pretty significant benefits. The disadvantage, of
                    course, is that you must accept <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> choices and
                    configurations, even if something different would be better for your
                    project. Usually canned sites are adjustable within certain narrow
                    parameters, but you will never get the fine-grained control you would
                    have if you set up the site yourself and had full administrative
                    access to the server.</p>

                <p>A perfect example of this is the handling of generated files.
                    Certain project web pages may be generated filesâfor example,
                    there are systems for keeping FAQ data in an easy-to-edit master
                    format, from which HTML, PDF, and other presentation formats can be
                    generated. As explained in
                    <a class="xref" href="#version-everything" title="Version everything">the section called âVersion
                        everythingâ</a><span>
earlier in this chapter</span>,
                    you wouldn't want to version the generated formats, only the master
                    file. But when your web site is hosted on someone else's server, it
                    may be difficult to set up a custom hook to regenerate the online
                    HTML version of the FAQ whenever the master file is changed.</p>

                <p>If you choose a canned site, try to leave open the option of
                    switching to a different site later, by using a custom domain name as the
                    project's development home address. You can forward that URL to the
                    canned site, or have a fully customized development home page at the
                    main URL and link to the canned site for specific functionality. Just
                    try to arrange things such that if you later decide to use a different
                    hosting solution, the project's main address doesn't need to
                    change.</p>

                <p>And if you're not sure whether to use canned hosting, then you
                    should probably use canned hosting. These sites have integrated their
                    services in myriad ways (just one example: if a commit mentions a bug
                    ticket number using a certain format, then people browsing that commit
                    later will find that it automatically links to that ticket), ways that
                    would be laborious for you to reproduce, especially if it's your first
                    time running an open source project. The universe of possible
                    configurations of collaboration tools is vast and complex, but the
                    same set of choices has faced everyone running an open source project
                    and there are some settled solutions now. Each of the canned hosting
                    sites implements a reasonable subset of that solution space, and
                    unless you have reason to believe you can do better, your project will
                    probably run best just using one of those sites.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>There are now so many sites providing free-of-charge canned
                        hosting for projects released under open source licenses that there is
                        not space here to review the field.</p>

                    <p>So I'll make this easy:</p>

                    <p>If you don't know what to choose, then choose <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/"
                                                                        target="_top">GitHub</a>. It's by far the most
                        popular and appears set to stay that way for some years to come. It
                        has a good set of features and integrations. Many developers are
                        already familiar with GitHub and have an account there. It has an
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://develop.github.com/" target="_top">API</a> for interacting
                        programmatically with project resources, and while it does not
                        currently offer mailing lists, there are plenty of other places you
                        can provision those, such as <a class="ulink" href="https://discourse.org/" target="_top">discourse.org</a>
                        and <a class="ulink" href="http://groups.google.com/" target="_top">Google Groups</a>.</p>

                    <p>If you're not convinced by GitHub (for example because your
                        project uses, say, Mercurial instead of Git for version control), but
                        you aren't sure where to host, take a look at Wikipedia's thorough
                        <a class="ulink"
                           href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities"
                           target="_top">comparison of open source software hosting facilities</a>; it's
                        the first place to look for up-to-date, comprehensive information on
                        open source project hosting options.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Hosting on fully open source infrastructure">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="hosting-on-freedom"></a>Hosting on fully open source
                                infrastructure</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Although all the canned hosting sites use plenty of free
                        software in their stack, most of them also wrote some proprietary
                        code to glue it all together. In these cases the hosting environment
                        itself is not fully open source, and thus cannot be easily reproduced
                        by others. For example, while Git itself is free software, GitHub is
                        a hosted service running partly with proprietary
                        software&nbsp;â&nbsp;if you leave GitHub, you can't take a copy
                        of their infrastructure with you, at least not all of it.</p>

                    <p>Some projects would prefer a canned hosting site that runs an
                        entirely free software infrastructure and that could, in theory, be
                        reproduced independently were that ever to become necessary.
                        Fortunately, there are a few such sites. As of mid-2015, <a class="ulink"
                                                                                    href="http://phacility.com"
                                                                                    target="_top">phacility.com</a>
                        offers low-cost
                        project hosting in <a class="ulink" href="http://phabricator.org/" target="_top">Phabricator</a>,
                        a fully open source web platform for open-source
                        style collaboration.</p>

                    <p>There is also <a class="ulink" href="http://gitlab.com/" target="_top">GitLab</a>,
                        which until recently was fully open source. However, they now seem to
                        offer an open source edition for self-hosting and an "enterprise
                        edition" that they host and that has a few features the open source
                        edition doesn't have. Unfortunately, GitLab.com doesn't currently
                        seem to offer a hosting package based on the strictly open source
                        edition, which is too bad, because that would be the best choice for
                        an open source project that wants to outsource hosting while
                        preserving its commitment, both philosophical and utilitarian, to
                        software freedom.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, any service that offers hosting of the <a class="ulink" href="http://redmine.org/"
                                                                              target="_top">Redmine</a> or <a
                            class="ulink" href="http://trac.edgewall.org" target="_top">Trac</a> code collaboration
                        platforms effectively offers fully freedom-preserving project hosting,
                        because those platforms include most of the features needed to run an
                        open source project. Some companies offer that kind of commercial
                        platform hosting with a zero-cost or very cheap rate for open source
                        projects.</p>

                    <p>Should you host your project on fully open source
                        infrastructure? While it would be ideal, from the free software
                        philosophical perspective, to have access to all the code that runs
                        the site, I cannot say I've seen any evidence that hosting or not
                        hosting on that kind of site has any effect on a project's success.
                        The vast majority of developers who work on free software projects are
                        willing to participate through a non-free hosting platform when that's
                        what the project is using.</p>

                    <p>In my opinion, the crucial thing is to be able to interact with
                        project data in automatable ways, and to have a way to export the
                        data. A site that meets these criteria can never truly lock you in,
                        and will even be somewhat extensible, via its programmatic interface.
                        While there is some value in having all the code that runs a hosting
                        site available under open source terms, in practice the demands of
                        actually deploying that code in a production environment are difficult
                        and sometimes prohibitive for most projects anyway. The largest of
                        these sites need multiple servers, customized networks, and full-time
                        staffs to keep them running; merely having the code would not be
                        sufficient to duplicate or "fork" them anyway. The main thing is just
                        to make sure your data isn't trapped.</p>

                    <p>Of course, all the above applies only to the servers of the
                        hosting site. Your project itself should never require participants
                        to run proprietary collaboration software on their own
                        machines.<sup>[<a name="idp6150112" href="#ftn.idp6150112" class="footnote">27</a>]</sup></p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Anonymity and involvement">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="anonymity"></a>Anonymity and involvement</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>A problem that is not strictly limited to the canned sites, but
                        is most often found there, is the over-requirement of user
                        registration to participate in various aspects of the project. The
                        proper degree of requirement is a bit of a judgement call. User
                        registration helps prevent spam, for one thing, and even if every
                        commit gets reviewed you still probably don't want anonymous strangers
                        pushing changes into your repository, for example.</p>

                    <p>But sometimes user registration ends up being required for tasks
                        that ought to be permitted to unregistered visitors, especially the
                        ability to file tickets in the bug tracker, and to comment on existing
                        tickets. By requiring a logged-in username for such actions, the
                        project raises the involvement bar for what should be quick,
                        convenient tasks. It also changes the demographics of who files bugs,
                        since those who take the trouble to set up a user account at the
                        project site are hardly a random sample even from among users who are
                        willing to file bugs (who in turn are already a biased subset of all
                        the project's users). Of course, one wants to be able to contact
                        someone who's entered data into the ticket tracker, but having a field
                        where she can enter her email address (if she wants to) is sufficient.
                        If a new user spots a bug and wants to report it, she'll only be
                        annoyed at having to fill out an account creation form before she can
                        enter the bug into the tracker. She may simply decide not to file the
                        bug at all.</p>

                    <p>If you have control over which actions can be done anonymously,
                        make sure that at least <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> read-only actions are
                        permitted to non-logged-in visitors, and if possible that data entry
                        portals, such as the bug tracker, that tend to bring information from
                        users to developers, can also be used anonymously, although of course
                        anti-spam techniques, such as captchas, may still be necessary.</p></div>

            <p>Discussion forums in which participants post and respond to
                messages are the bread and butter of project communications. For a
                long time these were mainly email-based discussion lists, but the
                distinction between Web-based forums and mailing lists is, thankfully,
                slowly disappearing. Services like <a class="ulink" href="https://groups.google.com/" target="_top">Google
                    Groups</a> (which is not
                itself open source) and <a class="ulink" href="http://Gmane.org/" target="_top">Gmane.org</a> (which is)
                have now established that
                cross-accessibility of message forums as mailing lists and vice versa
                is the minimum bar to meet, and modern discussion management systems
                like GroupServer and Sympa reflect this.</p>

            <p>Because of this nearly-completed unification between email lists
                and web-based forums<sup>[<a name="idp6160608" href="#ftn.idp6160608" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup>, I
                will
                use the terms <em class="firstterm">message&nbsp;forum</em> and
                <em class="firstterm">mailing&nbsp;list</em> more or less interchangeably.
                They refer to any kind of message-based forum where posts are linked
                together in threads (topics), people can subscribe, archives of past
                messages can be browsed, and the forum can be interacted with via
                email or via a web browser.</p>

            <p>If a user is exposed to any channel besides a project's web
                pages, it is most likely to be one of the project's message forums.
                But before she experiences the forum itself, she will experience the
                process of finding the right forums. Your project should
                have a prominently-placed description of all the available public
                forums, to give newcomers guidance in deciding which ones to browse or
                post to first. A typical such description might say something like
                this:</p><pre class="screen">  The mailing lists are the main day-to-day communication channels for
  the Scanley community.  You don't have to be subscribed to post to a
  list, but if it's your first time posting (whether you're subscribed
  or not), your message may be held in a moderation queue until a
  human moderator has a chance to confirm that the message is not spam.
  We're sorry for this delay; blame the spammers who make it necessary.

  Scanley has the following lists:

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">users&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    Discussion about using Scanley or programming with the Scanley
    API, suggestions of possible improvements, etc.  You can browse the
    users@ archives at <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to archive&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span> or subscribe here:
    <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">dev&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    Discussion about developing Scanley.  Maintainers and contributors
    are subscribed to this list.  You can browse the dev@ archives at
    <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to archive&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span> or subscribe here: <span
                    class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

    (Sometimes threads cross over between users@ and dev@, and
    Scanley's developers will often participate in discussions on both
    lists.  In general if you're unsure where a question or post
    should go, start it out on <code class="literal">users@</code>.  If it should be a
    development discussion, someone will suggest moving it over to
    <code class="literal">dev@</code>.)

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">announcements&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    This is a low-traffic, subscribe-only list.  The Scanley
    developers post announcements of new releases and occasional other
    news items of interest to the entire Scanley community here, but
    followup discussion takes place on users@ or dev@.
    <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">notifications&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    All code commit messages, bug tracker tickets, automated
    build/integration failures, etc, are sent to this list.  Most
    developers should subscribe: <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

  There is also a non-public list you may need to send to, although
  only developers are subscribed:

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">security&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    Where the Scanley project receives confidential reports of
    security vulnerabilities.  Of course, the report will be made
    public eventually, but only after a fix is released; see our
    security procedures page for more [...]

                            you will quickly realize it, and should consider switching

                <p>The point of the above list is really just to show that forum
                    management is a complex problem that has already been given a lot of
                    thought, and to some degree been solved. You don't need to become an
                    expert, but you will have to learn at least a little bit about
                    it, and you should expect list management to occupy your attention
                    from time to time in the course of running any free software project.
                    Below we'll examine a few of the most common issues.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Spam Prevention">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>

                    </div>
                    <p>Between when this sentence is written and when it is published,
                        the Internet-wide spam problem will probably double in
                        severityâor at least it will feel that way. There was a time,
                        not so long ago, when one could run a mailing list without taking any
                        spam-prevention measures at all. The occasional stray post would
                        still show up, but infrequently enough to be only a low-level
                        annoyance. That era is gone forever. Today, a mailing list that
                        takes no spam prevention measures will quickly be submerged in junk
                        emails, to the point of unusability. Spam prevention is
                        mandatory.</p>

                    <p>We divide spam prevention into two categories: preventing spam
                        posts from appearing on your mailing lists, and preventing your
                        mailing list from being a source of new email addresses for spammers'
                        harvesters. The former is more important to your project, so we
                        examine it first.</p>

                    <div class="sect4" title="Filtering posts">
                        <div class="titlepage">
                            <div>
                                <div><h5 class="title"><a name="spam-filtering"></a>Filtering posts</h5></div>

                        </div>
                        <p>There are three basic techniques for preventing spam posts, and
                            most mailing list software offers all three. They are best used in
                            tandem:</p>

                        <div class="orderedlist">
                            <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                                <li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Only auto-allow postings from
                                    list subscribers.</strong></span></p>

                                    <p>This is effective as far as it goes, and also
                                        involves very little administrative overhead, since it's
                                        usually just a matter of changing a setting in the mailing
                                        list software's configuration. But note that posts which
                                        aren't automatically approved must not be simply
                                        discarded. Instead, they should go into a moderation
                                        queue, for two reasons. First, you want to allow
                                        non-subscribers to post: a person with a question or
                                        suggestion should not need to subscribe to a mailing list
                                        just to ask a question there. Second, even
                                        subscribers may sometimes post from an address other than
                                        the one by which they're subscribed. Email addresses are
                                        not a reliable method of identifying people, and shouldn't
                                        be treated as such.</p></li>
                                <li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Filter posts through
                                    spam-detection software.</strong></span></p>

                                    <p>If the mailing list software makes it possible (most
                                        do), you can have posts filtered by spam-filtering
                                        software. Automatic spam-filtering is not perfect, and
                                        never will be, since there is a never-ending arms race
                                        between spammers and filter writers. However, it can
                                        greatly reduce the amount of spam that makes it through to the
                                        moderation queue, and since the longer that queue is the
                                        more time humans must spend examining it, any amount of
                                        automated filtering is beneficial.</p>

                                    <p>There is not space here for detailed instructions
                                        on setting up spam filters. You will have to consult
                                        your mailing list software's documentation for that (see
                                        <a class="xref" href="#mailing-list-software">the section called âMailing List /
                                            Message Forum Softwareâ</a><span> later in this chapter</span>). List
                                        software often comes with some built-in spam prevention
                                        features, but you may want to add some third-party
                                        filters. I've had good experiences with SpamAssassin
                                        (<a class="ulink" href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/" target="_top">spamassassin.apache.org</a>)
                                        and SpamProbe
                                        (<a class="ulink" href="http://spamprobe.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">spamprobe.sourceforge.net</a>),
                                        but this
                                        is not a comment on the many other open source spam
                                        filters out there, some of which are apparently also quite
                                        good. I just happen to have used those two myself and
                                        been satisfied with them.</p></li>
                                <li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Moderation.</strong></span></p>

                                    <p>For mails that aren't automatically allowed by
                                        virtue of being from a list subscriber, and which make it
                                        through the spam filtering software, if any, the last stage
                                        is <em class="firstterm">moderation</em>: the mail is routed
                                        to a special holding area, where a human examines it and
                                        confirms or rejects it.</p>

                                    <p>Confirming a post usually takes one of two forms:
                                        you can accept the sender's post just this once, or you
                                        can tell the system to allow this and all future posts
                                        from the same sender. You almost always want to do the
                                        latter, in order to reduce the future moderation
                                        burden&nbsp;â&nbsp;after all, someone who has made a
                                        valid post to a forum is unlikely to suddenly turn into a
                                        spammer later.</p>

                                    <p>Rejecting is done by either marking the item to be
                                        discarded, or by explicitly telling the system the message
                                        was spam so the system can improve its ability to
                                        recognize future spams. Sometimes
                                        you also have the option to automatically discard future
                                        mails from the same sender without them ever being held in
                                        the moderation queue, but there is rarely any point doing
                                        this, since spammers don't send from the same address
                                        twice anyway.</p>

                                    <p>Oddly, most message-forum systems have not yet given
                                        the moderation queue administrative interface the
                                        attention it deserves, considering how common the task is,
                                        so moderation often still requires more clicks and UI
                                        gestures than it should. I hope this situation will
                                        improve in the future. In the meantime, perhaps knowing
                                        you're not alone in your frustration will temper your
                                        disappointment somewhat.</p></li>

                        <p>Be sure to use moderation <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for
                            filtering out spams, and perhaps for clearly off-topic messages such
                            as when someone accidentally posts to the wrong mailing list.
                            Although the moderation system may give you a way to respond directly
                            to the sender, you should never use that method to answer questions
                            that really belong on the mailing list itself, even if you know the
                            answer off the top of your head. To do so would deprive the project's
                            community of an accurate picture of what sorts of questions people are
                            asking, and deprive people of a chance to answer questions themselves
                            and/or see answers from others. Mailing list moderation is strictly
                            about keeping the list free of spam and of wildly off-topic emails,
                            nothing more.</p></div>

                        <p>or some similarly obvious (to a human) encoding. Since spam
                            address harvesters often work by crawling through web
                            pagesâincluding your mailing list's online archivesâand
                            looking for sequences containing "@", encoding the addresses is a way
                            of making people's email addresses invisible or useless to spammers.
                            This does nothing to prevent spam from being sent to the mailing list
                            itself, of course, but it does avoid increasing the amount of spam
                            sent directly to list users' personal addresses.</p>

                        <p>Address hiding can be controversial. Some people like it a lot,
                            and will be surprised if your archives don't do it automatically.
                            Other people think it's too much of an inconvenience (because humans
                            also have to translate the addresses back before using them).
                            Sometimes people assert that it's ineffective, because a harvester
                            could in theory compensate for any consistent encoding pattern.
                            However, note that there is empirical evidence that address hiding
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> effective; see <a class="ulink"
                                                                                        href="http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml"
                                                                                        target="_top">cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml</a>.

                        <p>Ideally, the list management software would leave the choice up
                            to each individual subscriber, either through a special yes/no header
                            or a setting in that subscriber's list account preferences. However,
                            I don't know of any software which offers per-subscriber or per-post
                            choice in the matter, so for now the list manager must make a decision
                            for everyone (assuming the archiver offers the feature at all, which
                            is not always the case). For what it's worth, I lean toward turning
                            address hiding on. Some people are very careful to avoid posting
                            their email addresses on web pages or anywhere else a spam harvester
                            might see it, and they would be disappointed to have all that care
                            thrown away by a mailing list archive; meanwhile, the inconvenience
                            address hiding imposes on archive users is very slight, since it's
                            trivial to transform an obscured address back to a valid one if you
                            need to reach the person. But keep in mind that, in the end, it's
                            still an arms race: by the time you read this, harvesters might well
                            have evolved to the point where they can recognize most common forms
                            of hiding, and we'll have to think of something else.</p></div>

                    <p>When interacting with the forum by email, subscribers often want
                        to put mails from the list into a project-specific folder, separate
                        from their other mail. Their mail reading software can do this
                        automatically by examining the mail's <em class="firstterm">headers</em>.
                        The headers are the fields at the top of the mail that indicate the
                        sender, recipient, subject, date, and various other things about the
                        message. Certain headers are well known and are effectively
                        mandatory:</p><pre class="screen">From: ...
To: ...
Subject: ...
Date: ...
</pre>
                    <p>Others are optional, though still quite standard. For example,
                        emails are not strictly required to have the</p><pre class="screen">Reply-to: sender@email.address.here
</pre>
                    <p>header, but most do, because it gives recipients a foolproof way
                        to reach the author (it is especially useful when the author had to
                        send from an address other than the one to which replies should be
                        directed).</p>

                    <p>Some mail reading software offers an easy-to-use interface for
                        filing mails based on patterns in the Subject header. This leads
                        people to request that the mailing list add an automatic prefix to all
                        Subjects, so they can set their readers to look for that prefix and
                        automatically file the mails in the right folder. The idea is that
                        the original author would write:</p><pre class="screen">Subject: Making the 2.5 release.
</pre>
                    <p>but the mail would show up on the list looking like this:</p><pre class="screen">Subject: [Scanley Discuss] Making the 2.5 release.
</pre>
                    <p>Although most list management software offers the option to do
                        this, you may decide against turning the option on. The problem
                        it solves can often be solved in less obtrusive ways (see below), and
                        there is a cost to eating space in the Subject field. Experienced
                        mailing list users typically scan the Subjects of the day's incoming
                        list mail to decide what to read and/or respond to. Prepending the
                        list's name to the Subject can push the right side of the Subject off
                        the screen, rendering it invisible. This obscures information that
                        people depend on to decide what mails to open, thus reducing the
                        overall functionality of the mailing list for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Instead of munging the Subject header, your project could take
                        advantage of the other standard headers, starting with the To header,
                        which should say the mailing list's address:</p><pre class="screen">To: &lt;discuss@lists.example.org&gt;
</pre>
                    <p>Any mail reader that can filter on Subject should be able to filter on
                        To just as easily.</p>

                    <p>There are a few other optional-but-standard headers expected for
                        mailing lists; they are sometimes not displayed by most mailreader
                        software, but they are present nonetheless. Filtering on them is
                        even more reliable than using the "To" or "Cc" headers, and since these
                        headers are added to each post by the mailing list management software
                        itself, some users may be counting on their presence:</p><pre class="screen">list-help: &lt;mailto:discuss-help@lists.example.org&gt;
list-unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:discuss-unsubscribe@lists.example.org&gt;
list-post: &lt;mailto:discuss@lists.example.org&gt;

                    <p>For the most part, they are self-explanatory. See <a class="ulink"
                                                                            href="http://www.nisto.com/listspec/list-manager-intro.html"
                                                                            target="_top">nisto.com/listspec/list-manager-intro.html</a>

                    </p>

                    <p>Having said all that, these days I find that most subscribers
                        just request that the Subject header include a list-identifying
                        prefix. That's increasingly how people are accustomed to filtering
                        email: Subject-based filtering is what many of the major online email
                        services (like Gmail) offer users by default, and those services tend
                        not to make it easy to see the presence of less-commonly used headers
                        like the ones I mentioned above&nbsp;â&nbsp;thus making it hard
                        for people to figure out that they would even have the option of
                        filtering on those other headers.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, reluctantly, I recommend using a Subject prefix (keep
                        it as short as you can) if that's what your community wants. But if
                        your project highly technical and most of its participants are
                        comfortable using the other headers, then that option is always there
                        as a more space-efficient alternative.</p>

                    <p>It also used to be the case that if you have a mailing list
                        named "foo", then you also have administrative addresses "foo-help"
                        and "foo-unsubscribe" available. In addition to these, it was
                        traditional to have "foo-subscribe" for joining, and "foo-owner",
                        for reaching the list administrators. Increasingly, however,
                        subscribers manage their list membership via Web-based interfaces, so
                        even if the list management software you use sets up these
                        administrative addresses, they may go largely unused.</p>

                    <p>Some mailing list software offers an option to append
                        unsubscription instructions to the bottom of every post. If that
                        option is available, turn it on. It causes only a couple of extra
                        lines per message, in a harmless location, and it can save you a lot
                        of time, by cutting down on the number of people who mail youâor
                        worse, mail the list!âasking how to unsubscribe.</p></div>

                    <p>Earlier, in <a class="xref" href="#avoid-private-discussions" title="Avoid Private Discussions">the
                        section called âAvoid Private Discussionsâ</a>, I stressed the
                        importance of making sure discussions stay in public forums, and
                        talked about how active measures are sometimes needed to prevent
                        conversations from trailing off into private email threads;
                        furthermore, this chapter is all about setting up project
                        communications software to do as much of the work for people as possible.
                        Therefore, if the mailing list management software offers a way to
                        automatically cause discussions to stay on the list, you would think
                        turning on that feature would be the obvious choice.</p>

                    <p>Well, not quite. There is such a feature, but it has some
                        pretty severe disadvantages. The question of whether or not to use it
                        is one of the hottest debates in mailing list
                        managementâadmittedly, not a controversy that's likely to make
                        the evening news in your city, but it can flare up from time to time
                        in free software projects. Below, I will describe the feature, give
                        the major arguments on both sides, and make the best recommendation I
                        can.</p>

                    <p>The feature itself is very simple: the mailing list software
                        can, if you wish, automatically set the Reply-to header on every post
                        to redirect replies to the mailing list. That is, no matter what the
                        original sender puts in the Reply-to header (or even if they don't
                        include one at all), by the time the list subscribers see the post,
                        the header will contain the list address:</p><pre class="screen">Reply-to: discuss@lists.example.org
</pre>
                    <p>On its face, this seems like a good thing. Because virtually
                        all mail reading software pays attention to the Reply-to header, now
                        when anyone responds to a post, their response will be automatically
                        addressed to the entire list, not just to the sender of the message
                        being responded to. Of course, the responder can still manually
                        change where the message goes, but the important thing is that
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>by default</em></span> replies are directed to the list.
                        It's a perfect example of using technology to encourage
                        collaboration.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages. The first is known
                        as the <em class="firstterm">Can't Find My Way Back Home</em> problem:
                        sometimes the original sender will put their "real" email address in
                        the Reply-to field, because for one reason or another they send email
                        from a different address than where they receive it. People who
                        always read and send from the same location don't have this problem,
                        and may be surprised that it even exists. But for those who have
                        unusual email configurations, or who cannot control how the From
                        address on their mails looks (perhaps because they send from work and
                        do not have any influence over the IT department), using Reply-to may
                        be the only way they have to ensure that responses reach them. When
                        such a person posts to a mailing list that he's not subscribed to, his
                        setting of Reply-to becomes essential information. If the list
                        software overwrites it<sup>[<a name="idp6252128" href="#ftn.idp6252128" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup>,
                        he may
                        never see the responses to his post.</p>

                    <p>The second disadvantage has to do with expectations, and in my
                        opinion is the most powerful argument against Reply-to munging. Most
                        experienced mail users are accustomed to two basic methods of
                        replying: <em class="firstterm">reply-to-all</em> and
                        <em class="firstterm">reply-to-author</em>. All modern mail reading
                        software has separate keys for these two actions. Users know that to
                        reply to everyone (that is, including the list), they should choose
                        reply-to-all, and to reply privately to the author, they should choose
                        reply-to-author. Although you want to encourage people to reply to
                        the list whenever possible, there are certainly circumstances where a
                        private reply is the responder's prerogativeâfor example, they
                        may want to say something confidential to the author of the original
                        message, something that would be inappropriate on the public
                        list.</p>

                    <p>Now consider what happens when the list has overridden the
                        original sender's Reply-to. The responder hits the reply-to-author
                        key, expecting to send a private message back to the original author.
                        Because that's the expected behavior, he may not bother to look
                        carefully at the recipient address in the new message. He composes
                        his private, confidential message, one which perhaps says embarrassing
                        things about someone on the list, and hits the send key.
                        Unexpectedly, a few minutes later his message appears <span class="emphasis"><em>on the
                            mailing list!</em></span> True, in theory he should have looked
                        carefully at the recipient field, and should not have assumed anything
                        about the Reply-to header. But authors almost always set Reply-to to
                        their own personal address (or rather, their mail software sets it for
                        them), and many longtime email users have come to expect that. In
                        fact, when a person deliberately sets Reply-to to some other address,
                        such as the list, she usually makes a point of mentioning this in the
                        body of her message, so people won't be surprised at what happens when
                        they reply.</p>

                    <p>Because of the possibly severe consequences of this unexpected
                        behavior, my own preference is to configure list management software
                        to never touch the Reply-to header. This is one instance where using
                        technology to encourage collaboration has, it seems to me, potentially
                        dangerous side-effects. However, there are also some powerful
                        arguments on the other side of this debate. Whichever way you choose,
                        you will occasionally get people posting to your list asking why you
                        didn't choose the other way. Since this is not something you ever
                        want as the main topic of discussion on your list, it might be good to
                        have a canned response ready, of the sort that's more likely to stop
                        discussion than encourage it. Make sure you do
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> insist that your decision, whichever it is,
                        is obviously the only right and sensible one (even if you think that's
                        the case). Instead, point out that this is a very old debate, there
                        are good arguments on both sides, no choice is going to satisfy
                        all users, and therefore you just made the best decision you
                        could. Politely ask that the subject not be revisited unless someone
                        has something genuinely new to say, then stay out of the thread and
                        hope it dies a natural death.</p>

                    <p>Someone may suggest a vote to choose one way or the other. You
                        can do that if you want, but I personally do not feel that counting
                        heads is a satisfactory solution in this case. The penalty for
                        someone who is surprised by the behavior is so huge (accidentally
                        sending a private mail to a public list), and the inconvenience for
                        everyone else is fairly slight (occasionally having to remind someone
                        to respond to the whole list instead of just to you), that it's not
                        clear that the majority, even though they are the majority, should be
                        able to put the minority at such risk.</p>

                    <p>I have not addressed all aspects of this issue here, just the
                        ones that seemed of overriding importance. For a full discussion, see
                        these two canonical documents, which are the ones people always cite
                        when they're having this debate:

                        to get entangled in debates about it after that. When the debate
                        re-arises every few years, as it inevitably will, you can point people
                        to the archived discussion from last time.</p>

                        <p>Someday, someone will get the bright idea to implement a
                            <em class="firstterm">reply-to-list</em> key in a mail reader. It would
                            use some of the custom list headers mentioned earlier to figure out
                            the address of the mailing list, and then address the reply directly
                            to the list only, leaving off any other recipient addresses, since
                            most are probably subscribed to the list anyway. Eventually, other
                            mail readers will pick up the feature, and this whole debate will go
                            away. (Actually, the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mutt.org/" target="_top">Mutt</a>
                            mail reader does offer this feature.<sup>[<a name="idp6270128" href="#ftn.idp6270128"

                        <p>An even better solution would be for Reply-to munging to be a
                            per-subscriber preference. Those who want the list to set Reply-to
                            munged (either on others' posts or on their own posts) could ask for
                            that, and those who don't would ask for Reply-to to be left alone.
                            However, I don't know of any list management software that offers this
                            on a per-subscriber basis. For now, we seem to be stuck with a global
                            setting.<sup>[<a name="idp6272288" href="#ftn.idp6272288" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup></p>

                        scope of this book. If you have to choose or configure an archiver,
                        consider these qualities:</p>

                            <dd><p>People will often want to refer to an archived message
                                that was posted recently. If possible, the archiver
                                should archive each post instantaneously, so that by the
                                time a post appears on the mailing list, it's already
                                present in the archives. If that option isn't available,
                                then at least try to set the archiver to update itself
                                every hour or so. (By default, some archivers run their
                                update processes once per night, but in practice that's
                                far too much lag time for an active mailing list.)</p></dd>
                            <dt><span class="term">Referential stability</span></dt>
                            <dd><p>Once a message is archived at a particular URL, it should
                                remain accessible at that exact same URL forever, or as
                                close to forever as possible. Even if the archives are
                                rebuilt, restored from backup, or otherwise fixed, any
                                URLs that have already been made publicly available
                                should remain the same. Stable references make it
                                possible for Internet search engines to index the
                                archives, which is a major boon to users looking for
                                answers. Stable references are also important because
                                mailing list posts and threads are often linked to from
                                the bug tracker (see

                                from other project documents.</p>

                                <p>Ideally, mailing list software would include a message's
                                    archive URL, or at least the message-specific portion of
                                    the URL, in a header when it distributes the message to
                                    recipients. That way people who have a copy of the
                                    message would be able to know its archive location
                                    without having to actually visit the archives, which would
                                    be helpful because any operation that involves one's web
                                    browser is automatically time-consuming. Whether any
                                    mailing list software actually offers this feature, I don't
                                    know; unfortunately, the ones I have used do not.
                                    However, it's something to look for (or, if you write
                                    mailing list software, it's a feature to consider
                                    implementing, please).</p></dd>

                                    functions can be a bit hard to use. However, its advantages
                                    are substantial: your group's archives are always online and
                                    searchable; you don't have to worry about scalability,
                                    backups, or other run-time infrastructure issues; the
                                    moderation and spam-prevention features are pretty good (with
                                    the latter constantly being improved, which is important in
                                    the neverending spam arms race); and Google Groups are easily
                                    accessible via both email and web, in ways that are likely to
                                    be already familiar to many participants. These are strong
                                    advantages. If you just want to get your project started,
                                    and don't want to spend too much time thinking about what
                                    message forum software or service to use, Google Groups
                                    is a good default choice.</p></li>

                                <p>For many years, Mailman was the standard for open source
                                    project mailing lists. It comes with a built-in archiver,
                                    Pipermail, and hooks for plugging in external archivers.
                                    Unfortunately, Mailman is showing its age now, and while
                                    it is very reliable in terms of message delivery and other
                                    under-the-hood functionality, its administrative

                                    a look. It is supposed to solve many of the problems of

            <p>A <em class="firstterm">version control system</em> (or
                <em class="firstterm">revision control system</em>) is a combination of
                technologies and practices for tracking and controlling changes to a
                project's files, in particular to source code, documentation, and web
                pages. If you have never used version control before, the first thing
                you should do is go find someone who has, and get them to join your
                project. These days, everyone will expect at least your project's
                source code to be under version control, and probably will not take
                the project seriously if it doesn't use version control with at least
                minimal competence.</p>

            <p>The reason version control is so universal is that it helps with
                virtually every aspect of running a project: inter-developer
                communications, release management, bug management, code stability and
                experimental development efforts, and attribution and authorization of
                changes by particular developers. The version control system provides
                a central coordinating force among all of these areas. The core of
                version control is <em class="firstterm">change management</em>:
                identifying each discrete change made to the project's files,
                annotating each change with metadata like the change's date and
                author, and then replaying these facts to whoever asks, in whatever
                way they ask. It is a communications mechanism where a change is the
                basic unit of information.</p>

            <p>This section does not discuss all aspects of using a version
                control system. It's so all-encompassing that it must be addressed
                topically throughout the book. Here, we will concentrate on choosing
                and setting up a version control system in a way that will foster
                cooperative development down the road.</p>

                <p>This book cannot teach you how to use version control if you've
                    never used it before, but it would be impossible to discuss the
                    subject without a few key terms. These terms are useful independently
                    of any particular version control system: they are the basic nouns and
                    verbs of networked collaboration, and will be used generically
                    throughout the rest of this book. Even if there were no version
                    control systems in the world, the problem of change management would
                    remain, and these words give us a language for talking about that
                    problem concisely.</p>

                <p>If you're comfortably experienced with version control already,
                    you can probably skip this section. If you're not sure, then read
                    through this section at least once. Certain version control terms
                    have gradually changed in meaning since the early 2000s, and you may
                    occasionally find people using them in incompatible ways in the same
                    conversation. Being able to detect that phenomenon early in a
                    discussion can often be helpful.</p>

                        <p>The word <em class="firstterm">version</em> is sometimes used as a
                            synonym for "revision", but I will not use it that way in this
                            book, because it is too easily confused with "version" in the sense
                            of a version of a piece of softwareâthat is, the release or
                            edition number, as in "Version 1.0". However, since the phrase
                            "version control" is already standard, I will continue to use it as
                            a synonym for "revision control" and "change control". Sorry. One
                            of open source's most endearing characteristics is that it has two
                            words for everything, and one word for every two things.</p></div>

                                Mercurial) the developer chooses when and where to push commits.
                                Because the former types privilege a particular central repository,
                                they are known as "centralized" version control systems, while the

                            committed together as one conceptual unit, if multiple files were

                                the same: they give a way to speak precisely about exact points in
                                time in the history of a file or a set of files (say, immediately
                                before and after a bug is fixed). For example: "Oh yes, she fixed

                            Branches are also known as "lines of development". Even when a
                            project has no explicit branches, development is still considered
                            to be happening on the "main branch", also known as the "main line"

                            <p>Branches offer a way to keep different lines of development
                                from interfering with each other. For example, a branch can be used
                                for experimental development that would be too destabilizing for the
                                main trunk. Or conversely, a branch can be used as a place to
                                stabilize a new release. During the release process, regular
                                development would continue uninterrupted in the main branch of the
                                repository; meanwhile, on the release branch, no changes are allowed
                                except those approved by the release managers. This way, making a
                                release needn't interfere with ongoing development work. See <a class="xref"

                                interfere with each other, when one of the people updates their copy

                    GitHub. Because so many developers are already comfortable with that
                    combination, choosing it sends the signal that your project is ready
                    for participants. But Git-at-GitHub is not the only viable
                    combination. Two other reasonable choices of version control system
                    are <a class="ulink" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_top">Mercurial</a> and
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>.
                    Mercurial and Git are both decentralized systems, whereas Subversion
                    is centralized. All three are offered at many different free hosting
                    services; some services even support more than one of them (though
                    GitHub only supports Git, as its name suggests). While some projects
                    host their repositories on their own servers, most just put their
                    repositories on one of the free hosting services, as described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the section called âCanned
                        Hostingâ</a>.</p>

                <p>There isn't space here for an in-depth exploration of why you
                    might choose something other than Git. If you have a reason to do so,
                    then you already know what that reason is. If you don't, then just
                    use Git (and probably on GitHub). If you find yourself using
                    something other than Git, Mercurial, or Subversion, ask yourself
                    why&nbsp;â&nbsp;because whatever that other version control
                    system is, most other developers won't be familiar with it, and it
                    likely has a smaller and less stable community of support around it
                    than the big three do.</p></div>

                <p>The recommendations in this section are not targeted toward a
                    particular version control system, and should be implementable in any
                    of them. Consult your specific system's documentation for
                    details.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Version everything">
                    <div class="titlepage">

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Keep not only your project's source code under version control,
                        but also its web pages, documentation, FAQ, design notes, and anything
                        else that people might want to edit. Keep them right with the
                        source code, in the same repository tree. Any piece of information
                        worth writing down is worth versioningâthat is, any piece of
                        information that could change. Things that don't change should be
                        archived, not versioned. For example, an email, once posted, does not
                        change; therefore, versioning it wouldn't make sense (unless it becomes
                        part of some larger, evolving document).</p>

                    <p>The reason to version everything together in one place is so
                        that people only have to learn one mechanism for submitting changes.
                        Often a contributor will start out making edits to the web pages or
                        documentation, and move to small code contributions later, for
                        example. When the project uses the same system for all kinds of
                        submissions, people only have to learn the ropes once. Versioning
                        everything together also means that new features can be committed
                        together with their documentation updates, that branching the code
                        will branch the documentation too, etc.</p>

                    <p>Don't keep <em class="firstterm">generated files</em> under version
                        control. They are not truly editable data, since they are produced
                        programmatically from other files. For example, some build systems
                        create a file named <code class="filename">configure</code> based on a template
                        in <code class="filename">configure.in</code>. To make a change to the
                        <code class="filename">configure</code>, one would edit
                        <code class="filename">configure.in</code> and then regenerate; thus, only the
                        template <code class="filename">configure.in</code> is an "editable file."
                        Just version the templatesâif you version the generated files as
                        well, people will inevitably forget to regenerate them when they commit a
                        change to a template, and the resulting inconsistencies will cause no
                        end of confusion.</p>

                    <p>There are technical exceptions to the rule that all editable
                        data should be kept in the same version control system as the code.
                        For example, a project's bug tracker and its wiki hold plenty of
                        editable data, but usually do not store that data in the main version
                        control system<sup>[<a name="idp6391936" href="#ftn.idp6391936" class="footnote">32</a>]</sup>.
                        However,
                        they should still have versioning systems of their own, e.g., the
                        comment history in a bug ticket, and the ability to browse past
                        revisions and view differences between them in a wiki.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Browsability">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="vc-browsing"></a>Browsability</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>The project's repository should be browsable on the Web. This
                        means not only the ability to see the latest revisions of the
                        project's files, but to go back in time and look at earlier revisions,
                        view the differences between revisions, read log messages for selected
                        changes, etc.</p>

                    <p>Browsability is important because it is a lightweight portal to
                        project data. If the repository cannot be viewed through a web
                        browser, then someone wanting to inspect a particular file (say, to
                        see if a certain bugfix had made it into the code) would first have to
                        install version control client software locally, which could turn
                        their simple query from a two-minute task into a half-hour or longer
                        task.</p>

                    <p>Browsability also implies canonical URLs for viewing a
                        particular change (i.e., a commit), and for viewing the latest
                        revision at any given time without specifying its commit identifier.
                        This can be very useful in technical discussions or when pointing
                        people to documentation or examples. If you tell someone a URL that
                        always points to the latest revision of the a file, or to a particular
                        known version, the communication is completely unambiguous, while
                        avoiding the issue of whether the recipient has an up-to-date working
                        copy of the code themselves.</p>

                    <p>Some version control systems come with built-in
                        repository-browsing mechanisms, and in any case all hosting sites
                        offer it via their web interfaces. But if you need to install a
                        third-party tool to get repository browsing, do so; it's worth
                        it.</p></div>

                    <p>Non-expert version control users are sometimes a bit afraid of
                        branching and merging. If you are among those people, resolve right
                        now to conquer any fears you may have and take the time to learn how
                        to do branching and merging. They are not difficult operations, once
                        you get used to them, and they become increasingly important as a
                        project acquires more developers.</p>

                    <p>Branches are valuable because they turn a scarce
                        resourceâworking room in the project's codeâinto an
                        abundant one. Normally, all developers work together in the same
                        sandbox, constructing the same castle. When someone wants to add a
                        new drawbridge, but can't convince everyone else that it would be an
                        improvement, branching makes it possible for her to copy the
                        castle, take it off to an isolated corner, and try out the new
                        drawbridge design. If the effort succeeds, she can invite the
                        other developers to examine the result (in GitHub-speak, this
                        invitation is known as a "pull request"&nbsp;â&nbsp;see <a class="xref" href="#pull-requests"
                                                                                   title="Pull requests">the section
                            called âPull requestsâ</a>). If everyone agrees that the
                        result is good, she or someone else can tell the version control
                        system to move ("merge") the drawbridge from the branch version of the
                        castle over to the main version, sometimes called the
                        <em class="firstterm">master branch</em>.</p>

                    <p>It's easy to see how this ability helps collaborative
                        development. People need the freedom to try new things without
                        feeling like they're interfering with others' work. Equally
                        importantly, there are times when code needs to be isolated from the
                        usual development churn, in order to get a bug fixed or a release
                        stabilized (see <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">the
                            section called âStabilizing a Releaseâ</a> and
                        <a class="xref" href="#release-lines" title="Maintaining Multiple Release Lines">the section
                            called âMaintaining Multiple Release Linesâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Chapter&nbsp;7,
    <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>) without worrying
                        about tracking a moving target. At the same time, people need to be
                        able to review and comment on experimental work, whether it's
                        happening in the master branch or somewhere else. Treating branches
                        as first-class, publishable objects makes all this possible.</p>

                    <p>Use branches liberally, and encourage others to use them. But
                        also make sure that a given branch is only active for as long as
                        needed. Every active branch is a slight drain on the community's
                        attention. Even those who are not working in a branch still stumble
                        across it occasionally; it enters their peripheral awareness from time
                        to time and draws some attention. Sometimes such awareness is
                        desirable, of course, and commit notices should be sent out for branch
                        commits just as for any other commit. But branches should not become
                        a mechanism for dividing the development community's efforts. With
                        rare exceptions, the eventual goal of most branches should be to merge
                        their changes back into the main line and disappear, as soon as
                        possible.</p></div>

                    <p>Merging has an important corollary: never commit the same change
                        twice. That is, a given change should enter the version control
                        system exactly once. The revision (or set of revisions) in which the
                        change entered is its unique identifier from then on. If it needs to
                        be applied to branches other than the one on which it entered, then it
                        should be merged from its original entry point to those other
                        destinationsâas opposed to committing a textually identical
                        change, which would have the same effect in the code, but would make
                        accurate bookkeeping and release management much harder.</p>

                    <p>The practical effects of this advice differ from one version
                        control system to another. In some systems, merges are special
                        events, fundamentally distinct from commits, and carry their own
                        metadata with them. In others, the results of merges are committed
                        the same way other changes are committed, so the primary means of
                        distinguishing a "merge commit" from a "new change commit" is in the
                        log message. In a merge's log message, don't repeat the log message
                        of the original change. Instead, just indicate that this is a merge,
                        and give the identifying revision of the original change, with at most
                        a one-sentence summary of its effect. If someone wants to see the
                        full log message, she should consult the original revision.
                        Non-duplication makes it easier to be sure when one has tracked down
                        the original source of a change: when you're looking at a complete log
                        message that doesn't refer to a some other merge source, you can know
                        that it must be the original change, and treat it accordingly.</p>

                    <p>The same principle applies to reverting a change. If a change
                        is withdrawn from the code, then the log message for the reversion
                        should merely state that some specific revision(s) is being reverted,
                        and explain why. It should not describe the semantic code change that
                        results from the reversion, since that can be derived by consulting
                        the original log message and change. (And if you're using a system in
                        which editing past log messages is possible, such as Subversion, go
                        back and edit the original change's log message to mention the future
                        reversion.</p>

                    <p>All of the above implies that you should use a consistent syntax
                        for referring to changes. This is helpful not only in log messages,
                        but in emails, the bug tracker, and elsewhere. In Git and Mercurial,
                        the syntax is usually "commit bb2377" (where the commit hash code on
                        the right is long enough to be unique in the relevant context); in
                        Subversion, revision numbers are linearly incremented integers and the
                        standard syntax for, say, revision 1729 is "r1729". In other systems,
                        there is usually a standard syntax for expressing the changeset name.
                        Whatever the appropriate syntax is for your system, encourage people
                        to use it when referring to changes. Consistent expression of change

                    <p>Many version control systems offer a feature whereby certain
                        people can be allowed or disallowed from committing in specific
                        sub-areas of the master repository. Following the principle that when
                        handed a hammer, people start looking around for nails, many projects use
                        this feature with abandon, carefully granting people access to just
                        those areas where they have been approved to commit, and making sure
                        they can't commit anywhere else. (See
                        <a class="xref" href="#committers" title="Committers">the section called âCommittersâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span> for how projects
                        decide who can put changes where.)</p>

                    <p>Exercising such tight control is usually unnecessary, and may
                        even be harmful. Some projects simply use an honor system: when a
                        person is granted commit access, even for a sub-area of the project,
                        what they actually receive is the ability to commit anywhere in the
                        master repository. They're just asked to keep their commits in their
                        area. Remember that there is little real risk here: the repository
                        provides an audit trail, and in an active project, all commits are
                        reviewed anyway. If someone commits where they're not supposed to,
                        others will notice it and say something. If a change needs to be
                        undone, that's simple enoughâeverything's under version control
                        anyway, so just revert.</p>

                    <p>There are several advantages to this more relaxed approach.
                        First, as developers expand into other areas (which they usually will
                        if they stay with the project), there is no administrative overhead to
                        granting them wider privileges. Once the decision is made, the person
                        can just start committing in the new area right away.</p>

                    <p>Second, expansion can be done in a more fine-grained manner.
                        Generally, a committer in area X who wants to expand to area Y will
                        start posting patches against Y and asking for review. If someone who
                        already has commit access to area Y sees such a patch and approves of
                        it, she can just tell the submitter to commit the change directly
                        (mentioning the reviewer/approver's name in the log message, of
                        course). That way, the commit will come from the person who actually
                        wrote the change, which is preferable from both an information
                        management standpoint and from a crediting standpoint.</p>

                    <p>Last, and perhaps most important, using the honor system
                        encourages an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect. Giving someone
                        commit access to a subdomain is a statement about their technical
                        preparednessâit says: "We see you have expertise to make commits
                        in a certain domain, so go for it." But imposing strict authorization
                        controls says: "Not only are we asserting a limit on your expertise,
                        we're also a bit suspicious about
                        your <span class="emphasis"><em>intentions</em></span>." That's not the sort of
                        statement you want to make if you can avoid it. Bringing someone into
                        the project as a committer is an opportunity to initiate them into a
                        circle of mutual trust. A good way to do that is to give them more
                        power than they're supposed to use, then inform them that it's up to
                        them to stay within the stated limits.</p>

                    <p>The Subversion project has operated on this honor system way or
                        well over a decade, with more than 40 full committers and many more
                        partial committers as of this writing. The only distinction the
                        system actually enforces is
                        between committers and non-committers; further subdivisions are
                        maintained solely by human judgement. Yet the project never had a
                        serious problem with someone deliberately committing outside their
                        domain. Once or twice there's been an innocent misunderstanding about
                        the extent of someone's commit privileges, but it's always been
                        resolved quickly and amiably.</p>

                    <p>Obviously, in situations where self-policing is impractical, you
                        must rely on hard authorization controls. But such situations are
                        rare. Even when there are millions of lines of code and hundreds or
                        thousands of developers, a commit to any given code module should
                        still be reviewed by those who work on that module, and they can
                        recognize if someone committed there who wasn't supposed to. If
                        regular commit review <span class="emphasis"><em>isn't</em></span> happening, then the
                        project has bigger problems to deal with than the authorization system
                        anyway.</p>

                    <p>In summary, don't spend too much time fiddling with the version
                        control authorization system, unless you have a specific reason to. It
                        usually won't bring much tangible benefit, and there are advantages to
                        relying on human controls instead.</p>

                    <p>None of this should be taken to mean that the restrictions
                        themselves are unimportant, of course. It would be bad for a project
                        to encourage people to commit in areas where they're not qualified.
                        Furthermore, in many projects, full (unrestricted) commit access has a
                        special corollary status: it implies voting rights on project-wide
                        questions. This political aspect of commit access is discussed more

                <p>These days the primary means by which
                    changes&nbsp;â&nbsp;code contributions, documentation
                    contributions, etc&nbsp;â&nbsp;reach a project is via "pull
                    requests" (described in more detail below), though some older projects
                    still prefer to receive a patch posted to a mailing list or attached
                    in a bug tracker. Once a contribution arrives, it typically goes
                    through a review-and-revise process, involving communication between
                    the contributor and various members of the project. At some point
                    during the process, if all goes well, the contribution is eventually
                    deemed ready for incorporation into the main code base and is merged
                    in. This does not mean that discussion and work on the contribution
                    cease at that point. The contribution may well continue to be
                    improved, it's just that that improvement now takes place within the
                    project rather than off to one side. The moment when a code change is
                    merged to the project's master branch is when it becomes officially
                    part of the project. It is no longer the sole responsibility of
                    whoever submitted it; it is the collective responsibility of the
                    project as a whole.</p>

                    <p>A <em class="firstterm">pull request</em> is a request
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> a contributor <span
                                class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> the
                        project that a certain change be "pulled" into the project (usually
                        into the project's master branch, though sometimes pull requests are
                        targeted at some other branch).</p>

                    <p>The change is offered in the form of the difference between the
                        contributor's copy (or "clone") of the project and the project's own
                        copy. The two copies share most of their change history, of course,
                        but at a certain point the contributor's diverges&nbsp;â&nbsp;it
                        contains the change the contributor has implemented and that the
                        project does not have yet. The project may also have moved on since
                        the clone was made and contain new changes that the contributor does
                        not have, but these can be ignored for the purposes of discussion
                        here. A pull request is directional: it is for sending changes the
                        contributor has that the receiver does not, and is not about changes
                        flowing in the reverse direction.</p>

                    <p>In practice, the two copies are usually stored on the same
                        hosting site, and the contributor can initiate the pull request by
                        simply clicking a button. On GitHub, and perhaps on other hosting
                        sites, creating a pull request automatically creates a corresponding
                        ticket in the project's bug tracker, so that a pending pull request
                        can be conveniently tracked using the same workflow as any other
                        issue. Some projects have also contributions enter through a
                        collaborative code review tool, such as <a class="ulink"
                                                                   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_%28software%29"
                                                                   target="_top">Gerrit</a> or <a class="ulink"
                                                                                                  href="https://www.reviewboard.org/"
                                                                                                  target="_top">Review

                        features of code-review tools into its pull request management
                        interface.</p>

                    <p>Pull requests are so frequent a topic of discussion that you
                        will often see people abbreviate them as "PR", as in "Yeah, your
                        proposed fix sounds good. Would you send me a PR please?" For
                        newcomers, however, the term "pull request" is sometimes confusing,
                        however, because it sounds like it is request by the contributor to
                        pull a change from someone else, when actually it is a request the
                        contributor makes to to someone else (the project) to pull the change
                        from the contributor. Some systems use the term <em class="firstterm">merge
                            request</em> to mean the same thing. I actually find that term
                        much more natural, but alas, "pull request" appears to have won, and
                        we all need to just get used to it. I'm not bitter.</p></div>

                        containing a group of commits&nbsp;â&nbsp;should generate a
                        notification that goes out to a subscribable forum, such as an email
                        sent to a mailing list. The notification should show who made the
                        change, when they made it, what files and directories changed, and the
                        actual content of the change.</p>

                    <p>The most common form of commit notifications is just to have a
                        mailing list that developers or any interested party can subscribe to,
                        and send an email to that list for each commit or push. This is a
                        special mailing list devoted to commit emails, separate from the
                        mailing lists to which humans post. Developers should be encouraged
                        to subscribe to the commits list, as it is the most effective way to
                        keep up with what's happening in the project at the code level. Aside
                        from the obvious technical benefits of peer review (see <a class="xref" href="#code-review"
                                                                                   title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the

                        community, because they establish a shared environment in which people
                        can react to events that they know are visible to others as
                        well.</p>

                    <p>Whether your project should use an email list or some other kind
                        of subscribable notification forum depends on the demographics of your
                        developers, but when in doubt, email is usually a good default choice.
                        The specifics of setting up notifications will vary depending on your
                        version control system, but usually there's a script or other packaged
                        facility for doing it. If you're having trouble finding it, try
                        looking for documentation on <em class="firstterm">hooks</em> (or
                        sometimes <em class="firstterm">triggers</em>) specifically a
                        <em class="firstterm">post-merge hook</em> or <em class="firstterm">post-commit
                            hook</em> hook. These hooks are a general means of launching
                        automated tasks in response to receiving changes. The hook is fed all
                        the information about the merge, and is then free to use that
                        information to do anythingâfor example, to send out an
                        email.</p>

                    <p>With pre-packaged commit email systems, you may want to
                        modify some of the default behaviors:</p>

                    <div class="orderedlist">
                        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                            <li class="listitem"><p>Some commit mailers don't include the actual diffs in the
                                email, but instead provide a URL to view the change on the web using
                                the repository browsing system. While it's good to provide the URL,
                                so the change can be referred to later, it is also important that
                                the commit email include
                                the diffs themselves. Reading email is already part of people's
                                routine, so if the content of the change is visible right there in
                                the commit email, developers will review the commit on the spot,
                                without leaving their mail reader. If they have to click on a URL to
                                review the change, most won't do it, because that requires a new
                                action instead of a continuation of what they were already doing.
                                Furthermore, if the reviewer wants to ask something about the
                                change, it's vastly easier to hit reply-with-text and simply
                                annotate the quoted diff than it is to visit a web page and
                                laboriously cut-and-paste parts of the diff from web browser to
                                email client.</p>

                                <p>(Of course, if the diff is huge, such as when a large body of
                                    new code has been added to the repository, then it makes sense to
                                    omit the diff and offer only the URL. Most commit mailers can do
                                    this kind of size-limiting automatically. If yours can't, then it's
                                    still better to include diffs, and live with the occasional huge
                                    email, than to leave the diffs off entirely. Convenient reviewing
                                    and commenting is a cornerstone of cooperative development, and much
                                    too important to do without.)</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>The commit emails should set their Reply-to header
                                to the regular development list, not the commit email list. That
                                is, when someone reviews a commit and writes a response, their
                                response should be automatically directed toward the human
                                development list, where technical issues are normally discussed.
                                There are a few reasons for this. First, you want to keep all
                                technical discussion on one list, because that's where people expect
                                it to happen, and because that way there's only one archive to
                                search. Second, there might be interested parties not subscribed to
                                the commit email list. Third, the commit email list advertises
                                itself as a service for watching commits, not for watching commits
                                <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> having occasional technical discussions.
                                Those who subscribed to the commit email list did not sign up for
                                anything but commit emails; sending them other material via that
                                list would violate an implicit contract.</p>

                                <p>Note that this advice to set Reply-to does not contradict the
                                    recommendations in

                                    always okay for the <span class="emphasis"><em>sender</em></span> of a message to

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Bug tracking is a broad topic; various aspects of it are
                discussed throughout this book. Here I'll concentrate mainly on the
                features your project should look for in a bug tracker, and how to use
                them. But to get to those, we have to start with a policy question:
                exactly what kind of information should be kept in a bug
                tracker?</p>

            <p>The term <em class="firstterm">bug tracker</em> is misleading. Bug
                tracking systems are used to track not only bug reports, but new
                feature requests, one-time tasks, unsolicited patchesâreally
                anything that has distinct beginning and end states, with optional
                transition states in between, and that accrues information over its
                lifetime. For this reason, bug trackers are also called
                <em class="firstterm">issue trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">ticket
                    trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">defect trackers</em>,
                <em class="firstterm">artifact trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">request
                    trackers</em>, etc.</p>

            <p>In this book, I'll generally use the word
                <em class="firstterm">ticket</em> to refer the items in the tracker's
                database, because that distinguishes between the behavior that the
                user encountered or proposed&nbsp;â&nbsp;that is, the bug or
                feature itself&nbsp;â&nbsp;and the tracker's ongoing
                <span class="emphasis"><em>record</em></span> of that discovery, diagnosis, discussion,
                and eventual resolution. But note that many projects use the word
                <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>issue</em></span> to refer to
                both the ticket itself and to the underlying behavior or goal that the
                ticket is tracking. (In fact, those usages are probably more common than
                "ticket"; it's just that in this book we need to be able to make that
                distinction explicitly in a way that projects themselves usually
                don't.)</p>

            <p>The classic ticket life cycle looks like this:

            </p>

            <div class="orderedlist">
                <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Someone files the ticket. They provide a summary, an
                        initial description (including a reproduction recipe, if
                        applicable; see
                        <a class="xref" href="#users-to-volunteers" title="Treat Every User as a Potential Volunteer">the
                            section called âTreat Every User as a Potential Volunteerâ</a><span> in
            <a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8,
                <i>Managing Volunteers</i></a></span> for
                        how to encourage good bug reports), and whatever other
                        information the tracker asks for. The person who files
                        the ticket may be totally unknown to the projectâbug
                        reports and feature requests are as likely to come from
                        the user community as from the developers.</p>

                        <p>Once filed, the ticket is in what's called an
                            <em class="firstterm">open</em> state. Because no action has
                            been taken yet, some trackers also label it as
                            <em class="firstterm">unverified</em> and/or
                            <em class="firstterm">unstarted</em>. It is not assigned to
                            anyone; or, in some systems, it is assigned to a fake
                            user to represent the lack of real assignation. At this
                            point, it is in a holding area: the ticket has been
                            recorded, but not yet integrated into the project's
                            consciousness.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Others read the ticket, add comments to it, and
                        perhaps ask the original filer for clarification on some
                        points.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets <em class="firstterm">reproduced</em>.
                        This may be the most important moment in its
                        life cycle. Although the bug is not actually fixed yet,
                        the fact that someone besides the original filer was able
                        to make it happen proves that it is genuine, and, no less
                        importantly, confirms to the original filer that they've
                        contributed to the project by reporting a real bug.
            <span class="emphasis"><em>(This step and some of the others don't apply to
                feature proposals, task tickets, etc, of course. But most
                filings are for genuine bugs, so we'll focus on that
                here.)</em></span></p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets <em class="firstterm">diagnosed</em>: its
                        cause is identified, and if possible, the effort required
                        to fix it is estimated. Make sure these things get
                        recorded in the ticket; if the person who diagnosed the
                        bug suddenly has to step away from it for a
                        while, someone else should be able to pick up where she
                        left off.</p>

                        <p>In this stage, or sometimes in the previous one,
                            a developer may "take ownership" of the ticket and
                            <em class="firstterm">assign</em> it to herself (<a class="xref"
                                                                                href="#delegation-assignment"

                            examines the assignment process in more detail). The ticket's
                            <em class="firstterm">priority</em> may also be set at this
                            stage. For example, if it is so important that it should
                            delay the next release, that fact needs to be identified
                            early, and the tracker should have some way of noting
                            it.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The ticket gets scheduled for resolution.
                        Scheduling doesn't necessarily mean naming a date by which
                        it will be fixed. Sometimes it just means deciding which
                        future release (not necessarily the next one) the bug
                        should be fixed by, or deciding that it need not block any
                        particular release. Scheduling may also be dispensed
                        with, if the bug is quick to fix.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets fixed (or the task completed, or
                        the patch applied, or whatever). The change or set of
                        changes that fixed it should be discoverable from
                        the ticket. After this, the ticket is
                        <em class="firstterm">closed</em> and/or marked as
                        <em class="firstterm">resolved</em>.</p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p>There are some common variations on this life cycle. Sometimes
                a ticket is closed very soon after being filed, because it turns out
                not to be a bug at all, but rather a misunderstanding on the part of
                the user. As a project acquires more users, more and more such
                invalid tickets will come in, and developers will close them with
                increasingly short-tempered responses. Try to guard against the
                latter tendency. It does no one any good, as the individual user in
                each case is not responsible for all the previous invalid tickets; the
                statistical trend is visible only from the developers' point of view,
                not the user's. (In
                <a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">the section called
                    âPre-Filtering the Bug Trackerâ</a><span> later
in this chapter,</span> we'll look at
                techniques for reducing the number of invalid tickets.) Also, if
                different users are experiencing the same misunderstanding over and
                over, it might mean that aspect of the software needs to be
                redesigned. This sort of pattern is easiest to notice when there is
                an issue manager monitoring the bug database; see
                <a class="xref" href="#issue-manager" title="Issue Manager">the section called âIssue Managerâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>.</p>

            <p>Another common life event for the ticket to be closed
                as a <em class="firstterm">duplicate</em> soon after Step 1. A duplicate
                is when someone reports something that's already known to the project.
                Duplicates are not confined to open tickets: it's possible for a bug to
                come back after having been fixed (this is known as a
                <em class="firstterm">regression</em>), in which case a reasonable course
                is to reopen the original ticket and close any new reports as
                duplicates of the original one. The bug tracking system should keep
                track of this relationship bidirectionally, so that reproduction
                information in the duplicates is available to the original ticket, and
                vice versa.</p>

            <p>A third variation is for the developers to close the ticket,
                thinking they have fixed it, only to have the original reporter reject
                the fix and reopen it. This is usually because the developers simply
                don't have access to the environment necessary to reproduce the bug,
                or because they didn't test the fix using the exact same reproduction
                recipe as the reporter.</p>

            <p>Aside from these variations, there may be other small details of
                the life cycle that vary depending on the tracking software. But the
                basic shape is the same, and while the life cycle itself is not
                specific to open source software, it has implications for how open
                source projects use their bug trackers.</p>

            <p>The tracker is as much a public face of the project as the
                mailing lists or web pages. Anyone may file a ticket, anyone may look
                at a ticket, and anyone may browse the list of currently open tickets.
                It follows that you never know how many people are waiting to see
                progress on a given ticket. While the size and skill of the
                development community constrains the rate at which tickets can be
                resolved, the project should at least try to acknowledge each ticket
                the moment it appears. Even if the ticket lingers for a while, a
                response encourages the reporter to stay involved, because she feels
                that a human has registered what she has done (remember that filing a
                ticket usually involves more effort than, say, posting an email).
                Furthermore, once a ticket is seen by a developer, it enters the
                project's consciousness, in the sense that the developer can be on the
                lookout for other instances of the ticket, can talk about it with
                other developers, etc.</p>

            <p>This centrality to the life of the project implies a few things
                about trackers' technical features:

                    <li class="listitem"><p>The tracker should have APIs. I cannot stress the
                        importance of this enough. If there is no way to interact with
                        the tracker programmatically, then in the long run there is no way
                        to interact with it scalably. APIs provide a route to customizing
                        the behavior of the tracker by, in effect, expanding it to include
                        third-party software. Instead of being just the specific ticket
                        tracking software running on a server somewhere, it's that
                        software <span class="emphasis"><em>plus</em></span> whatever custom behaviors your
                        project implements elsewhere and plugs in to the tracker via the
                        APIs.</p>

                        <p>Also, if your project uses a proprietary ticket tracker,
                            as is becoming more common now that so many projects host their
                            code on proprietary-but-free-of-charge hosting sites and just use
                            the site's built-in tracker, APIs provide a way to avoid being
                            locked in to that hosting platform. You can, in theory, take the
                            ticket history with you if you choose to go somewhere else (you
                            may never exercise this option, but think of it as
                            insurance&nbsp;â&nbsp;and some projects have actually done
                            it).</p>

                        <p>Currently, the ticket trackers of the big three hosting
                            sites (GitHub, Google Code Hosting, and SourceForge) all have
                            APIs, fortunately. Of them, only SourceForge is itself open

                <p>Most trackers now have at least decent email integration
                    features: at a minimum, the ability to create new tickets by email,
                    the ability to "subscribe" to a ticket to receive
                    emails about activity on that ticket, and the ability to add new
                    comments to a ticket by email. Some trackers even allow one to
                    manipulate ticket state (e.g., change the status field, the assignee,
                    etc) by email, and for people who use the tracker a lot, such as an
                    <a class="xref" href="#issue-manager" title="Issue Manager">the section called âIssue Managerâ</a>,
                    that can make a
                    huge difference in their ability to stay on top of tracker activity
                    and keep things organized.</p>

                <p>The tracker email feature that is likely to be used by everyone,
                    though, is simply the ability to read a ticket's activity by email and
                    respond by email. This is a valuable time-saver for many people in
                    the project, since it makes it easy to integrate bug traffic into
                    one's daily email flow. But don't let this integration give
                    anyone the illusion that the total collection of bug tickets and their
                    email traffic is the equivalent of the development mailing list. It's
                    not, and <a class="xref" href="#choose-the-forum" title="Choose the Right Forum">the section called

                <p>Most ticket databases eventually suffer from the same problem: a
                    crushing load of duplicate or invalid tickets filed by well-meaning but
                    inexperienced or ill-informed users. The first step in combatting
                    this trend is usually to put a prominent notice on the front page of
                    the bug tracker, explaining how to tell if a bug is really a bug, how
                    to search to see if it's already been reported, and finally, how to
                    effectively report it if one still thinks it's a new bug.</p>

                <p>This will reduce the noise level for a while, but as the number
                    of users increases, the problem will eventually come back. No
                    individual user can be blamed for it. Each one is just trying to
                    contribute to the project's well-being, and even if their first bug
                    report isn't helpful, you still want to encourage them to stay
                    involved and file better tickets in the future. In the meantime,
                    though, the project needs to keep the ticket database as free of junk
                    as possible.</p>

                <p>The two things that will do the most to prevent this problem
                    are: making sure there are people watching the bug tracker who have
                    enough knowledge to close tickets as invalid or duplicates the moment
                    they come in, and requiring (or strongly encouraging) users to confirm
                    their bugs <span class="emphasis"><em>with other people</em></span> before filing them
                    in the tracker.</p>

                <p>The first technique seems to be used universally. Even projects
                    with huge ticket databases (say, the Debian bug tracker at
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.debian.org/" target="_top">bugs.debian.org</a>, which
                    contained 739,542 tickets as of this writing) still arrange things so that
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> sees each ticket that comes in. It may be
                    a different person depending on the category of the ticket. For
                    example, the Debian project is a collection of software packages, so
                    Debian automatically routes each ticket to the appropriate package
                    maintainers. Of course, users can sometimes misidentify a ticket's
                    category, with the result that the ticket is sent to the wrong person
                    initially, who may then have to reroute it. However, the important
                    thing is that the burden is still sharedâwhether the user
                    guesses right or wrong when filing, ticket watching is still
                    distributed more or less evenly among the developers, so each ticket is
                    able to receive a timely response.</p>

                <p>The second technique is less widespread, probably because it's
                    harder to automate. The essential idea is that every new ticket gets
                    "buddied" into the database. When a user thinks he's found a problem,
                    he is asked to describe it on one of the mailing lists, or in an IRC
                    channel, and get confirmation from someone that it is indeed a bug.
                    Bringing in that second pair of eyes early can prevent a lot of
                    spurious reports. Sometimes the second party is able to identify that
                    the behavior is not a bug, or is fixed in recent releases. Or she may
                    be familiar with the symptoms from a previous ticket, and can prevent a
                    duplicate filing by pointing the user to the older ticket. Often it's
                    enough just to ask the user "Did you search the bug tracker to see if
                    it's already been reported?" Many people simply don't think of that,
                    yet are happy to do the search once they know someone's
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>expecting</em></span> them to.</p>

                <p>The buddy system can really keep the ticket database clean, but
                    it has some disadvantages too. Many people will file solo anyway,
                    either through not seeing, or through disregarding, the instructions
                    to find a buddy for new tickets. Thus it is still necessary for
                    volunteers to watch the ticket database. Furthermore, because most new
                    reporters don't understand how difficult the task of maintaining the
                    ticket database is, it's not fair to chide them too harshly for
                    ignoring the guidelines. Thus the volunteers must be vigilant, and
                    yet exercise restraint in how they bounce unbuddied tickets back to
                    their reporters. The goal is to train each reporter to use the
                    buddying system in the future, so that there is an ever-growing pool
                    of people who understand the ticket-filtering system. On seeing an
                    unbuddied ticket, the ideal steps are:</p>

                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Immediately respond to the ticket, politely thanking the user
                            for filing, but pointing them to the buddying guidelines
                            (which should, of course, be prominently posted on the web
                            site).</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>If the ticket is clearly valid and not a duplicate, approve it
                            anyway, and start it down the normal life cycle. After all,
                            the reporter's now been informed about buddying, so there's
                            no point closing a valid ticket and wasting the work done so
                            far.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Otherwise, if the ticket is not clearly valid, close it, but
                            ask the reporter to reopen it if they get confirmation from
                            a buddy. When they do, they should put a reference to the
                            confirmation thread (e.g., a URL into the mailing list
                            archives).</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>Remember that although this system will improve the signal/noise
                    ratio in the ticket database over time, it will never completely stop
                    the misfilings. The only way to prevent misfilings entirely is to
                    close off the bug tracker to everyone but developersâa cure that
                    is almost always worse than the disease. It's better to accept that
                    cleaning out invalid tickets will always be part of the project's
                    routine maintenance, and to try to get as many people as possible to
                    help.</p>

                (<em class="firstterm">IRC</em>), forums where users and developers can
                ask each other questions and get instant responses. IRC has been
                around for a long time, and its primarily text-based interface and

                and it is a key communications forum for many open source projects.

            <p>If you've never used IRC before, don't be daunted. It's not

                the channel's availabity from your project's web site, so a visitor
                with a quick question will see it right away.<sup>[<a name="idp6517120" href="#ftn.idp6517120"

                channel gets
                too noisy, you can divide into multiple channels, for example one for
                installation problems, another for usage questions, another for
                development chat, etc (<a class="xref" href="#growth" title="Handling Growth">the section called
                    âHandling Growthâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#communications"

                discusses when and how to divide into multiple channels). But when
                your project is young, there should only be one channel, with everyone
                talking together. Later, as the user-to-developer ratio increases,
                separate channels may become necessary.</p>

            <p>How will people know all the available channels, let alone which
                channel to talk in? And when they talk, how will they know what the
                local conventions are?</p>

            <p>The answer is to tell them by setting the <em class="firstterm">channel
                topic</em>.<sup>[<a name="idp6534800" href="#ftn.idp6534800" class="footnote">37</a>]</sup> The channel
                topic is a brief
                message each user sees when they first enter the channel. It gives
                quick guidance to newcomers, and pointers to further information. For
                example:</p><pre class="screen">The Apache (TM) Subversion (R) version control system

</pre>
            <p>That's terse, but it tells newcomers what they need to know. It
                says exactly what the channel is for, gives the project home page (in
                case someone wanders into the channel without having first been to the
                project web site), gives a pointer to some documentation, and gives
                recent release news.</p>

            <div class="sidebar" title="Paste Sites"><a name="paste-sites"></a>

                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><p class="title"><b>Paste Sites</b></p></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>An IRC channel is a shared space: everyone can see what everyone
                    else is saying. Normally, this is a good thing, as it allows people
                    to jump into a conversation when they think they have something to
                    contribute, and allows spectators to learn by watching. But it
                    becomes problematic when someone has to provide a large quantity of
                    information at once, such as a large error message or a transcript
                    from a debugging session, because pasting too many lines of output
                    into the room will disrupt other conversations.</p>

                <p>The solution is to use one of the
                    <em class="firstterm">pastebin</em> or <em class="firstterm">pastebot</em>
                    sites. When requesting a large amount of data from someone, ask them
                    not to paste it into the channel, but instead to go to (for example)
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.ca/" target="_top">pastebin.ca</a>, paste their
                    data into the form there, and tell the resulting new URL to the IRC
                    channel. Anyone can then visit the URL and view the data.</p>

                <p>There are many free paste sites available, far too many for a
                    comprehensive list. Three that I seen used a lot are GitHub Gists
                    (<a class="ulink" href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_top">gist.github.com</a>),
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://paste.lisp.org/" target="_top">paste.lisp.org</a> and <a class="ulink"
                                                                                                           href="http://pastebin.ca/"
                                                                                                           target="_top">pastebin.ca</a>.
                    But there are many
                    other fine ones, and it's okay if different people in your IRC channel
                    choose to use different paste sites.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="IRC Bots">

                </div>
                <a name="bots"></a>

                <p>Many technically-oriented IRC channels have a non-human member,
                    a so-called <em class="firstterm">bot</em>, that is capable of storing and
                    regurgitating information in response to specific commands.
                    Typically, the bot is addressed just like any other member of the
                    channel, that is, the commands are delivered by "speaking to" the bot.
                    For example:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;kfogel&gt; wayita: learn diff-cmd = http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; Thanks!
</pre>
                <p>That told the bot, who is logged into the channel as wayita, to
                    remember a certain URL as the answer to the query "diff-cmd" (wayita
                    responded, confirming with a "Thanks!"). Now we can address wayita,
                    asking the bot to tell another user about diff-cmd:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;kfogel&gt; wayita: tell jrandom about diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; jrandom: http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre>
                <p>The same thing can be accomplished via a convenient shorthand:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;kfogel&gt; !a jrandom diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; jrandom: http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre>
                <p>The exact command set and behaviors differ from bot to bot
                    (unfortunately, the diversity of IRC bot command languages seems to be
                    rivaled only by the diversity of wiki syntaxes). The above example
                    happens to be with <code class="literal">wayita</code> (<a class="ulink"
                                                                               href="http://repos.borg.ch/svn/wayita/trunk/"
                                                                               target="_top">repos.borg.ch/svn/wayita/trunk</a>),
                    of which there is usually an
                    instance running in <code class="literal">#svn</code> at Freenode, but there are
                    many other IRC bots available. Note that no special server privileges
                    are required to run a bot. A bot is just like any other user joining
                    a channel.</p>

                <p>If your channel tends to get the same questions over and over,
                    I highly recommend setting up a bot. Only a small percentage of
                    channel users will acquire the expertise needed to manipulate the bot,
                    but those users will answer a disproportionately high percentage of
                    questions, because the bot enables them to respond so much more
                    efficiently.</p>

                    <a name="cia"></a>

                    <p>You can also configure a bot to watch your project's version
                        control repository and broadcast commit activity to the relevant IRC
                        channels. Though of somewhat less technical utility than commit
                        emails, since observers might or might not be around when a commit
                        notice pops up in IRC, this technique is of immense
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>social</em></span> utility. People get the sense of being
                        part of something alive and active, and feel that they can see
                        progress being made right before their eyes. And because the
                        notifications appear in a shared space, people in the chat room will
                        often react in real time, reviewing the commit and commenting on it on
                        the spot. The technical details of setting this up are beyond the
                        scope of this book, but it's usually worth the effort. This service

                <p>Although it is possible to publicly archive everything that
                    happens in an IRC channel, it's not necessarily expected. IRC
                    conversations are nominally public, but many people think of them as
                    informal and ephemeral conversations. Users may be careless with
                    grammar, and often express opinions (for example, about other software
                    or other programmers) that they wouldn't want preserved forever in a
                    searchable online archive. Of course, there will sometimes be
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>excerpts</em></span> that get quoted elsewhere, and that's
                    fine. But indiscriminate public logging may make some users uneasy.
                    If you do archive everything, make sure you state so clearly in the
                    channel topic, and give a URL to the archive.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div class="sect1" title="Wikis">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="wikis"></a>Wikis</h2></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>When open source software project wikis go bad, they usually go
                bad for the same reasons: lack of consistent organization and editing,
                leading to a mess of outdated and redundant pages, and lack of clarity
                on who the target audience is for a given page or section.</p>

            <p>A well-run wiki can be a wonderful thing for users, however, and
                is worth some effort to maintain. Try to have a clear page
                organization strategy and even a pleasing visual layout, so that
                visitors (i.e., potential editors) will instinctively know how to fit
                their contributions in. Make sure the intended audience is clear at
                all times to all editors. Most importantly, document these standards
                in the wiki itself and point people to them, so editors have somewhere
                to go for guidance. Too often, wiki administrators fall victim to the
                fantasy that because hordes of visitors are individually adding high
                quality content to the site, the sum of all these contributions must
                therefore also be of high quality. That's not how collaborative
                editing works. Each individual page or paragraph may be good when
                considered by itself, but it will not be good if embedded in a
                disorganized or confusing whole.</p>

            <p>In general, wikis will amplify any failings that are present
                from early on, since contributors tend to imitate whatever patterns
                they see in front of them. So don't just set up the wiki and hope
                everything falls into place. You must also prime it with well-written
                content, so people have a template to follow.</p>

            <p>The shining example of a well-run wiki is Wikipedia, of course,
                and in some ways it makes a poor example because it gets so much more
                editorial attention than any other wiki in the world. Still, if you
                examine Wikipedia closely, you'll see that its administrators laid a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> thorough foundation for cooperation. There
                is extensive documentation on how to write new entries, how to
                maintain an appropriate point of view, what sorts of edits to make,
                what edits to avoid, a dispute resolution process for contested edits
                (involving several stages, including eventual arbitration), and so
                forth. They also have authorization controls, so that if a page is
                the target of repeated inappropriate edits, they can lock it down
                until the problem is resolved. In other words, they didn't just throw
                some templates onto a web site and hope for the best. Wikipedia works
                because its founders give careful thought to getting thousands of
                strangers to tailor their writing to a common vision. While you may
                not need the same level of preparedness to run a wiki for a free
                software project, the spirit is worth emulating.</p>

                <p>Never allow open, anonymous editing on your wiki. The days when
                    that was possible are <span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> gone now; today, any
                    open wiki other than Wikipedia will be covered completely with spam in
                    approximately 3 milliseconds. (Wikipedia is an exception because it
                    has an exceptionally large number of readers willing to clean up spam
                    quickly, and because it has a well-funded organization behind it
                    devoted to resisting spam using various large-scale monitoring
                    techniques not practically available to smaller projects.)</p>

                <p>All edits in your project's wiki must come from registered
                    users; if your wiki software doesn't already enforce this by default,
                    then configure it to enforce that. Even then you may need to keep
                    watch for spam edits from users who registered under false pretences
                    for the purpose of spamming.</p></div>

                <p>If your project is on GitHub or some other free hosting site,
                    it's usually best to use the built-in wiki feature that most such
                    sites offer. That way your wiki will be automatically integrated with
                    your repository or other project permissions, and you can rely on the
                    site's user account system instead of having a separate registration
                    system for the wiki.</p>

                <p>If you are setting up your own wiki, then you're free to choose
                    which one, and fortunately there are plenty of good free software wiki
                    implementations available. I've had good experience with DokuWiki

                    a wonderful tool called the Wiki Choice Wizard at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/"
                                                                         target="_top">wikimatrix.org</a> that allows
                    you to specify the features you care about (an open source license can
                    be one of them) and then view a chart comparing all the wiki software
                    that meets those criteria. Another good resource is Wikipedia's own
                    list of wikis: <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software"
                                      target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software</a>.</p>

                <p>I do not recommend using MediaWiki (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.mediawiki.org" target="_top">mediawiki.org</a>)
                    as the wiki
                    software for most projects. MediaWiki is the software on which
                    Wikipedia itself runs, and while it is very good at that, its
                    administrative facilities are tuned to the needs of a site unlike any
                    other wiki on the Net&nbsp;â&nbsp;and actually not so well-tuned
                    to the needs of smaller editing communities. Many projects are
                    tempted to choose MediaWiki because they think it will be easier for
                    users who already know its editing syntax from having edited at
                    Wikipedia, but this turns out to be an almost non-existent advantage
                    for several reasons. First, wikis in general, including Wikipedia,
                    are tending toward rich-text in-browser editing anyway, so that no one
                    really needs to learn the underlying wiki syntax unless they aim to be
                    a power user. Second, many other wikis offer a MediaWiki-syntax
                    plugin, so you can have that syntax anyway if you really want it.
                    Third, for those who will use a plaintext syntax instead of rich-text
                    editing, it's better to use a standardized generic markup format like
                    Markdown (<a class="ulink" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_top">daringfireball.net/projects/markdown</a>),
                    which is available in
                    many wikis either natively or via a plugin, than to use a wiki syntax
                    of any flavor. If you support Markdown, then people can edit in your
                    wiki using the same markup syntax they already know from GitHub and
                    other popular tools.</p></div>

            <p>In the past few years, online question-and-answer forums (or
                <em class="firstterm">Q&amp;A forums</em>) have gone from being an
                afterthought offered by the occasional project to an increasingly
                expected and normal component of user-facing services. A high-quality
                Q&amp;A forum is like a FAQ with nearly real-time
                updates&nbsp;â&nbsp;indeed, if your Q&amp;A forum is
                sufficiently healthy, it often makes sense to either use it directly
                as your project's FAQ, or have the FAQ consist mostly of pointers to
                the forum's most popular items.</p>

            <p>A project can certainly host its own forums, and many do, using
                free software such as <a class="ulink" href="http://askbot.com" target="_top">Askbot</a>

                However, there are also some third-party services
                that aggregate questions and answers, the best-known of which, <a class="ulink"
                                                                                  href="http://stackoverflow.com/"

                frequently
                has its answers coming up first in generic search engine results for
                popular questions.</p>

            <p>While Stack Overflow hosts Q&amp;A about many things, not just
                about open source projects, it seems to have found the right
                combination of cultural guidelines and upvoting/downvoting features to
                enable its contributors to quickly narrow in on good answers for
                questions about open source software in particular. (The questions
                and answers on Stack Overflow are freely licensed, although the code
                that runs the site itself is not open source.) On the other hand,
                projects that host their own Q&amp;A forums are lately doing pretty
                well in search engine results too. It may be that the current
                dominance of Stack Overflow, as of this writing in 2014, is partly
                just an accident of timing, and that the real lesson is that
                Q&amp;A-style forums are an important addition to the free software
                project communications toolbox&nbsp;â&nbsp;one that scales
                better with user base than many other tools do.</p>

            <p>There is no definite answer to the question of whether or when
                you should set up dedicated Q&amp;A forums for your project. It
                depends on available resources, on the type of project, the
                demographics of the user community, etc. But do keep an eye out for
                Stack Overflow results, or other third-party results, coming up in
                generic question-style searches about your project. Their presence may
                indicate that it's time to consider setting up a dedicated Q&amp;A
                forum. Whether you do or not, the project can still learn a lot from
                looking at what people are asking on Stack Overflow, and at the
                responses.</p></div>
        <div class="sect1" title="Social Networking Services">
            <div class="titlepage">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Perhaps surprisingly for such social endeavors, open source
                projects typically make only limited use of what most people think of
                as "social networking" services. But this seeming omission is really
                a matter of definition: most of the infrastructure that open source
                projects have been using for decades, since long before "social
                networking" became a recognized category of software, is actually
                social networking software even if it isn't called that. The reason
                open source projects tend not to have much presence <span style="color: red">&lt;em&gt;as
projects&lt;/em&gt;</span> on, say, Facebook is just that the services Facebook
                offers are not well-tuned to what open source projects need. On the
                other hand, as you might expect, the infrastructure these projects
                have been using and improving for many years <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
                quite well-tuned to their needs.</p>

            <p>Most projects do use Twitter and similar microblog services,
                because sending out short quips and announcements that can be easily
                forwarded and replied to is a good way for a project to have
                conversations with its community; see LibreOffice's "@AskLibreOffice"
                tweet stream at <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/AskLibreOffice" target="_top">twitter.com/AskLibreOffice</a>
                for an example of this. Projects
                also sometimes use services such as <a class="ulink" href="https://www.eventbrite.com" target="_top">Eventbrite.com</a>
                and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.Meetup.com" target="_top">Meetup.com</a> to arrange in-person
                meetings of users and developers.</p>

            <p>But beyond lightweight services such as those, most free
                software projects do not maintain a large presence on mainstream
                social media platforms (though individual developers sometimes do, of
                course, and they may discuss the project there). The reward the
                project gets in exchange for that investment of time and attention
                appears not to be high enough to be worth the effort.</p></div>

            <p>The first questions people usually ask about free software are
                "How does it work? What keeps a project running? Who makes the
                decisions?" I'm always dissatisfied with bland responses about
                meritocracy, the spirit of cooperation, code speaking for itself, etc.
                The fact is, the question is not easy to answer. Meritocracy,
                cooperation, and running code are all part of it, but they do little
                to explain how projects actually run on a day-to-day basis, and say
                nothing about how conflicts are resolved.</p>

            <p>This chapter tries to show the structural underpinnings
                successful projects have in common. I mean "successful" not just in
                terms of technical quality, but in terms of operational health and
                survivability. Operational health is the project's ongoing ability to
                incorporate new code contributions and new developers, and to be
                responsive to incoming bug reports. Survivability is the project's
                ability to exist independently of any individual participant or
                sponsorâthink of it as the likelihood that the project would
                continue even if all of its founding members were to move on to other
                things<sup>[<a name="idp6530000" href="#ftn.idp6530000" class="footnote">39</a>]</sup>.
                Technical success is not hard to achieve, but without a
                robust developer base and social foundation, a project may be unable
                to handle the growth that initial success brings, or the departure of
                charismatic individuals.</p>

            <p>There are various ways to achieve this kind of success. Some
                involve a formal governance structure, by which debates are resolved,
                new developers are invited in (and sometimes out), new features
                planned, and so on. Others use less formal structure, but more
                self-restraint, to produce an atmosphere of fairness that
                people can rely on as a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> form
                of governance. Both ways lead to the same result: a sense of
                institutional permanence, supported by habits and procedures that are
                well understood by everyone who participates. These features are even
                more important in self-organizing systems than in centrally-controlled
                ones, because in self-organizing systems, everyone is conscious that a
                few bad apples can spoil the whole barrel, at least for a while.</p>

            <div class="sect1" title="Forkability">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The indispensable ingredient that binds developers together on a
                    free software project, and makes them willing to compromise when
                    necessary, is the code's <em class="firstterm">forkability</em>: the
                    ability of anyone to take a copy of the source code and use it to
                    start a competing project, known as a <em class="firstterm">fork</em>.
                    The paradoxical thing is that the <span class="emphasis"><em>possibility</em></span> of
                    forks is usually a much greater force in free software projects than
                    actual forks, which are very rare. Because a fork is usually bad for
                    everyone (for reasons examined in detail in
                    <a class="xref" href="#forks" title="Forks">the section called âForksâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>), the more serious
                    the threat of a fork becomes, the more willing people are to
                    compromise to avoid it.</p>

                <p>Forks, or rather the potential for forks, are the reason there
                    are no true dictators in free software projects. This may seem like a
                    surprising claim, considering how common it is to hear someone called
                    the "dictator" (sometimes softened to "benevolent dictator") in a
                    given open source project. But this kind of dictatorship is special,
                    quite different from the conventional understanding of the word.
                    Imagine a king whose subjects could copy his entire kingdom at any
                    time and move to the copy to rule as they see fit. Would not such a
                    king govern very differently from one whose subjects were bound to
                    stay under his rule no matter what he did?</p>

                <p>This is why even projects that are not formally organized as
                    democracies are, in practice, democracies when it comes to important
                    decisions. Replicability implies forkability; forkability implies
                    consensus. It may well be that everyone is willing to defer to one
                    leader (the most famous example being Linus Torvalds in Linux kernel
                    development), but this is because they <span class="emphasis"><em>choose</em></span> to
                    do so, in an entirely non-cynical and non-sinister way. The dictator
                    has no magical hold over the project. A key property of all open
                    source licenses is that they do not give one party more power than any
                    other in deciding how the code can be changed or used. If the dictator
                    were to suddenly start making bad decisions, there would be
                    restlessness, followed eventually by revolt and a fork. Except, of
                    course, that things rarely get that far, because the dictator compromises
                    first.</p>

                <p>But just because forkability puts an upper limit on how much
                    power anyone can exert in a project doesn't mean there aren't
                    important differences in how projects are governed. You don't want
                    every decision to come down to the last-resort question of who might
                    consider a fork. That would get tiresome very quickly, and sap
                    energy away from real work. The next two sections examine different
                    ways to organize projects such that most decisions go smoothly. These
                    two examples are somewhat idealized extremes; many projects fall
                    somewhere along a continuum between them.</p></div>

        <div class="sect1" title="Benevolent Dictators">

            <p>The <em class="firstterm">benevolent dictator</em> model is exactly
                what it sounds like: final decision-making authority rests with one
                person, who, by virtue of personality and experience, is expected
                to use it wisely.</p>

            <p>Although "benevolent dictator" (or <em class="firstterm">BD</em>)is
                the standard term for this role, it would be better to think of it as
                "community-approved arbitrator" or "judge". Generally, benevolent
                dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even most of the
                decisions. It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise
                to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project,
                and anyway, quality developers won't stay around unless they have some
                influence on the project's direction. Therefore, benevolent dictators
                commonly do not dictate much. Instead, they let things work
                themselves out through discussion and experimentation whenever
                possible. They participate in those discussions themselves, but as
                regular developers, often deferring to an area maintainer who has more
                expertise. Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached,
                and that most of the group <span class="emphasis"><em>wants</em></span> someone to guide
                the decision so that development can move on, does she put her foot
                down and say "This is the way it's going to be." Reluctance to make
                decisions by fiat is a trait shared by almost all successful
                benevolent dictators; it is one of the reasons they manage to keep the
                role.</p>

                <p>Being a BD requires a combination of traits. It needs, first of
                    all, a well-honed sensitivity to one's own influence in the project,
                    which in turn brings self-restraint. In the early stages of a
                    discussion, one should not express opinions and conclusions with so
                    much certainty that others feel like it's pointless to dissent.
                    People must be free to air ideas, even stupid ideas. It is inevitable
                    that the BD will post a stupid idea from time to time too, of course,
                    and therefore the role also requires an ability to recognize and
                    acknowledge when one has made a bad decisionâthough this is
                    simply a trait that <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> good developer should
                    have, especially if she stays with the project a long time. But the
                    difference is that the BD can afford to slip from time to time without
                    worrying about long-term damage to her credibility. Developers with
                    less seniority may not feel so secure, so the BD should phrase
                    critiques or contrary decisions with some sensitivity for how much
                    weight her words carry, both technically and psychologically.</p>

                <p>The BD does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to have the sharpest
                    technical skills of anyone in the project. She must be skilled enough
                    to work on the code herself, and to understand and comment on any
                    change under consideration, but that's all. The BD position is
                    neither acquired nor held by virtue of intimidating coding skills.
                    What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important is experience and overall
                    design senseânot necessarily the ability to produce good
                    design on demand, but the ability to recognize and endorse good
                    design, whatever its source.</p>

                <p>It is common for the benevolent dictator to be a founder of the
                    project, but this is more a correlation than a cause. The sorts of
                    qualities that make one able to successfully start a
                    projectâtechnical competence, ability to persuade other people
                    to join, and so onâare exactly the qualities any BD would need. And
                    of course, founders start out with a sort of automatic seniority,
                    which can often be enough to make benevolent dictatorship by the
                    founder appear the path of least resistance for all concerned.</p>

                <p>Remember that the potential to fork goes both ways. A BD can
                    fork a project just as easily as anyone else, and some have
                    occasionally done so, when they felt that the direction they wanted to
                    take the project was different from where the majority of other
                    developers wanted to go. Because of forkability, it does not matter
                    whether the benevolent dictator has control over the currently
                    accepted "master" project repository. People sometimes talk of repository
                    control as though it were the ultimate source of power in a project,
                    but in fact it is irrelevant. The ability to add or remove people's
                    commit passwords for one project on a particular hosting site affects
                    only that copy of the project on that site. Prolonged abuse of that
                    power, whether by the BD or someone else, would simply lead to
                    development moving to a different copy of the project.</p></div>
            <p>Whether your project should have a benevolent dictator, or would
                run better with some less centralized form of governance, largely
                depends on who is available to fill the role. As a general rule, if
                it's simply obvious to everyone who should be the BD, then that's the
                way to go. But if no candidate for BD is immediately obvious, then
                the project should probably use a decentralized decision-making
                process, as described in the next section.</p></div>
        <div class="sect1" title="Consensus-based Democracy">
            <div class="titlepage">

            </div>
            <p>As projects get older, they tend to move away from the
                benevolent dictatorship model and toward more openly democratic
                systems. This is not necessarily out of dissatisfaction with a
                particular BD. It's simply that group-based governance is more
                "evolutionarily stable", to borrow a biological metaphor. Whenever a
                benevolent dictator steps down, or attempts to spread decision-making
                responsibility more evenly, it is an opportunity for the group to
                settle on a new, non-dictatorial systemâestablish a
                constitution, as it were. The group may not take this opportunity the
                first time, or the second, but eventually they will; once they do,
                the decision is unlikely ever to be reversed. Common sense explains
                why: if a group of N people were to vest one person with special
                power, it would mean that N&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 people were each agreeing to
                decrease their individual influence. People usually don't want to do
                that. Even if they did, the resulting dictatorship would still be
                conditional: the group anointed the BD, clearly the group could depose
                the BD. Therefore, once a project has moved from leadership by a
                charismatic individual to a more formal, group-based system, it rarely
                moves back.</p>

            <p>The details of how these systems work vary widely, but there are
                two common elements: one, the group works by consensus most of the
                time; two, there is a formal voting mechanism to fall back on when
                consensus cannot be reached.</p>

            <p><em class="firstterm">Consensus</em> simply means an agreement that
                everyone is willing to live with. It is not an ambiguous state: a
                group has reached consensus on a given question when someone proposes
                that consensus has been reached and no one contradicts the assertion.
                The person proposing consensus should, of course, state specifically
                what the consensus is, and what actions would be taken in consequence
                of it, if those are not obvious.</p>

            <p>Most conversation in a project is on technical topics, such as
                the right way to fix a certain bug, whether or not to add a feature,
                how strictly to document interfaces, etc. Consensus-based governance
                works well because it blends seamlessly with the technical discussion
                itself. By the end of a discussion, there is often general agreement
                on what course to take. Someone will usually make a concluding post,
                which is simultaneously a summary of what has been decided and an
                implicit proposal of consensus. This provides a last chance for
                someone else to say "Wait, I didn't agree to that. We need to hash
                this out some more."</p>

            <p>For small, uncontroversial decisions, the proposal of consensus
                is implicit. For example, when a developer spontaneously commits a
                bugfix, the commit itself is a proposal of consensus: "I assume we all
                agree that this bug needs to be fixed, and that this is the way to fix
                it." Of course, the developer does not actually say that; she just
                commits the fix, and the others in the project do not bother to state
                their agreement, because silence is consent. If someone commits a
                change that turns out <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have consensus, the
                result is simply for the project to discuss the change as though it
                had not already been committed. The reason this works is the topic of
                the next section.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Version Control Means You Can Relax">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="version-control-relaxation"></a>Version Control Means You Can

                </div>
                <p>The fact that the project's source code is kept under version
                    control means that most decisions can be easily unmade. The most
                    common way this happens is that someone commits a change mistakenly
                    thinking everyone would be happy with it, only to be met with
                    objections after the fact. It is typical for such objections to start
                    out with an obligatory apology for having missed out on prior
                    discussion, though this may be omitted if the objector finds no record
                    of such a discussion in the mailing list archives. Either way, there
                    is no reason for the tone of the discussion to be different after the
                    change has been committed than before. Any change can be
                    reverted<sup>[<a name="idp7168896" href="#ftn.idp7168896" class="footnote">40</a>]</sup>, at least
                    until dependent changes are
                    introduced (i.e., new code that would break if the original change
                    were suddenly removed). The version control system gives the project
                    a way to undo the effects of bad or hasty judgement. This, in turn,
                    frees people to trust their instincts about how much feedback is
                    necessary before doing something.</p>

                <p>This also means that the process of establishing consensus need
                    not be very formal. Most projects handle it by feel. Minor changes
                    can go in with no discussion, or with minimal discussion followed by a
                    few nods of agreement. For more significant changes, especially ones
                    with the potential to destabilize a lot of code, people should wait a
                    day or two before assuming there is consensus, the rationale being
                    that no one should be marginalized in an important conversation simply
                    because he didn't check email frequently enough.</p>

                <p>Thus, when someone is confident she knows what needs to be done,
                    she should just go ahead and do it. This applies not only to software
                    fixes, but to web site updates, documentation changes, and anything
                    else unlikely to be controversial. Usually there will be only a few
                    instances where an action draws disapproval, and these can be handled on
                    a case-by-case basis. Of course, one shouldn't encourage people to be
                    headstrong. There is still a psychological difference between a
                    decision under discussion and one that has already taken effect but is
                    technically reversible. People always feel that momentum is
                    allied to action, and will be slightly more reluctant to revert a
                    change than to prevent it in the first place. If a developer abuses
                    this fact by committing potentially controversial changes too quickly,
                    however, people can and should complain, and hold that developer to a
                    stricter standard until things improve.</p></div>

                <p>Inevitably, some debates just won't consense. When all other
                    means of breaking a deadlock fail, the solution is to vote. But
                    before a vote can be taken, there must be a clear set of choices on
                    the ballot. Here, again, the normal process of technical discussion
                    blends serendipitously with the project's decision-making procedures.
                    The kinds of questions that come to a vote often involve complex,
                    multifaceted issues. In any such complex discussion, there are
                    usually one or two people playing the role of <em class="firstterm">honest
                        broker</em>: posting periodic summaries of the various
                    arguments and keeping track of where the core points of disagreement
                    (and agreement) lie. These summaries help everyone measure how much
                    progress has been made toward resolving the issues, and remind
                    everyone of what questions remain to
                    be addressed. Those same summaries can serve as prototypes for a
                    ballot sheet, should a vote become necessary. If the honest brokers
                    have been doing their job well, they will be able to credibly call for
                    a vote when the time comes, and the group will be willing to use a
                    ballot sheet based on their summary of the issues. The brokers
                    themselves may be participants in the debate; it is not necessary for
                    them to remain above the fray, as long as they can understand and
                    fairly represent others' views, and not let their partisan sentiments
                    prevent them from summarizing the state of the debate accurately.</p>

                <p>The actual content of the ballot is usually not controversial
                    By the time matters reach a vote, the disagreement has usually boiled
                    down to a few key issues, with recognizable labels and brief
                    descriptions. Occasionally a developer will object to the form of the
                    ballot itself. Sometimes his concern is legitimate, for example
                    that an important choice was left off or not described accurately.
                    But other times a developer may be merely trying to stave off the
                    inevitable, perhaps knowing that the vote probably won't go his way.

                <p>Remember to specify the voting method, as there are many
                    different kinds, and people might make wrong assumptions about which
                    procedure is being used. A good choice in most cases is

                    voter can vote
                    for as many of the choices on the ballot as she likes. Approval
                    voting is simple to explain and to count. See <a class="ulink"
                                                                     href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system"

                    for more details about
                    approval voting and other voting systems, but beware the temptation to
                    geek out on voting systems. I did, in the course of researching this
                    paragraph, and I've never been the same since. You can try all sorts
                    of fancy voting methods, for example ones that involve preferential
                    ranking of choices&nbsp;â&nbsp;such as
                    <em class="firstterm">Borda</em>, <em class="firstterm">Condorcet</em>,
                    <em class="firstterm">instant runoff</em>, and <em class="firstterm">single
                        transferable vote</em>&nbsp;â&nbsp;but a famous result
                    known as <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem"
                                target="_top">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a> has already demonstrated that
                    no voting system is perfect. Try to avoid getting into a long debate
                    about which voting system to use (because, of course, you will then
                    find yourself in a debate about which voting system to use to decide
                    the voting system!). Approval voting is a very good choice for the
                    kinds of ballots an open source project is likely to use to resolve
                    technical or procedural questions.</p>

                <p>Finally, conduct votes in public as much as possible. There is
                    no need for secrecy or anonymity in a vote on matters that have been
                    debated publicly anyway. Have each participant post her votes to the
                    project mailing list, so that any observer can tally and check the
                    results for herself, and so that everything is recorded in the
                    archives. If you prefer to use specialized software to conduct the
                    vote, as of this writing in mid-2015 the open source voting system
                    Helios (<a class="ulink" href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/"
                               target="_top">vote.heliosvoting.org</a>) is a good choice and supports approval
                    voting.</p></div>

                </div>
                <p>The hardest thing about voting is determining when to do it. In
                    general, taking a vote should be very rareâa last resort for
                    when all other options have failed. Don't think of voting as a great
                    way to resolve debates. It isn't. It ends discussion, and thereby
                    ends creative thinking about the problem. As long as discussion
                    continues, there is the possibility that someone will come up with a
                    new solution everyone likes. This happens surprisingly often: a
                    lively debate can produce a new way of looking at the problem, and
                    lead to a proposal that eventually satisfies everyone. Even when no
                    new proposal arises, it's still usually better to broker a compromise
                    than to hold a vote. After a compromise, everyone is a little bit
                    unhappy, whereas after a vote, some people are unhappy while others
                    are happy. From a political standpoint, the former situation is
                    preferable: at least each person can feel he extracted a price for his
                    unhappiness. He may be dissatisfied, but so is everyone else.</p>

                <p>Voting's only function is that it finally settles a question so
                    everyone can move on. But it settles it by a head count, instead of
                    by rational dialogue leading everyone to the same conclusion. The
                    more experienced people are with open source projects, the less eager
                    I find them to be to settle questions by vote. Instead they will try
                    to explore previously unconsidered solutions, or compromise more
                    severely than they'd originally planned. Various techniques are
                    available to prevent a premature vote. The most obvious is simply to
                    say "I don't think we're ready for a vote yet," and explain why not.
                    Another is to ask for an informal (non-binding) show of hands. If the
                    response clearly tends toward one side or another, this will make some
                    people suddenly more willing to compromise, obviating the need for a
                    formal vote. But the most effective way is simply to offer a new
                    solution, or a new viewpoint on an old suggestion, so that people
                    re-engage with the issues instead of merely repeating the same
                    arguments.</p>

                <p>In certain rare cases, everyone may agree that all the
                    compromise solutions are worse than any of the non-compromise ones.
                    When that happens, voting is less objectionable, both because it is
                    more likely to lead to a superior solution and because people will not
                    be overly unhappy no matter how it turns out. Even then, the vote
                    should not be rushed. The discussion leading up to a vote is what
                    educates the electorate, so stopping that discussion early can lower
                    the quality of the result.</p>

                <p>(Note that this advice to be reluctant to call votes does not
                    apply to the change-inclusion voting described in <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release"

                    the change review process so that everyone can tell how much review a
                    given change has received. It also does not apply to standard
                    procedural elections, for example choosing the board of directors for
                    a project organized as a non-profit legal entity.)</p></div>

                <p>Having a voting system raises the question of electorate: who
                    gets to vote? This has the potential to be a sensitive issue, because
                    it forces the project to officially recognize some people as being
                    more involved, or as having better judgement, than others.</p>

                <p>The best solution is to simply take an existing distinction,
                    commit access, and attach voting privileges to it. In projects that
                    offer both full and partial commit access, the question of whether
                    partial committers can vote largely depends on the process by which
                    partial commit access is granted. If the project hands it out
                    liberally, for example as a way of maintaining many third-party
                    contributed tools in the repository, then it should be made clear that
                    partial commit access is really just about committing, not voting.
                    The reverse implication naturally holds as well: since full committers
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> have voting privileges, they must be chosen
                    not only as programmers, but as members of the electorate. If someone
                    shows disruptive or obstructionist tendencies on the mailing list, the
                    group should be very cautious about making him a committer, even if
                    the person is technically skilled.</p>

                <p>The voting system itself should be used to choose new
                    committers, both full and partial. But here is one of the rare
                    instances where secrecy is appropriate. You can't have votes about
                    potential committers posted to a public mailing list, because the
                    candidate's feelings (and reputation) could be hurt. Instead, the
                    usual way is that an existing committer posts to a private mailing
                    list consisting only of the other committers, proposing that someone
                    be granted commit access. The other committers speak their minds
                    freely, knowing the discussion is private. Often there will be no
                    disagreement, and therefore no vote necessary. After waiting a few
                    days to make sure every committer has had a chance to respond, the
                    proposer mails the candidate and offers him commit access. If there
                    is disagreement, discussion ensues as for any other question, possibly
                    resulting in a vote. For this process to be open and frank, the mere
                    fact that the discussion is taking place at all should be secret. If
                    the person under consideration knew it was going on, and then were
                    never offered commit access, he could conclude that he had lost
                    the vote, and would likely feel hurt. Of course, if someone
                    explicitly asks for commit access, then there is no choice but to
                    consider the proposal and explicitly accept or reject him. If the
                    latter, then it should be done as politely as possible, with a clear
                    explanation: "We liked your patches, but haven't seen enough of them
                    yet," or "We appreciate all your patches, but they required
                    considerable adjustments before they could be applied, so we don't
                    feel comfortable giving you commit access yet. We hope that this will
                    change over time, though." Remember, what you're saying could come as
                    a blow, depending on the person's level of confidence. Try to see it
                    from their point of view as you write the mail.</p>

                <p>Because adding a new committer is more consequential than most
                    other one-time decisions, some projects have special requirements for
                    the vote. For example, they may require that the proposal receive at
                    least <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> positive votes and no negative votes, or
                    that a supermajority vote in favor. The exact parameters are not
                    important; the main idea is to get the group to be careful about
                    adding new committers. Similar, or even stricter, special requirements
                    can apply to votes to <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> a committer, though
                    hopefully that will never be necessary. See <a class="xref" href="#committers" title="Committers">the
                        section called âCommittersâ</a><span> in

                <p>For certain kinds of votes, it may be useful to expand the
                    electorate. For example, if the developers simply can't figure out
                    whether a given interface choice matches the way people actually use
                    the software, one solution is to ask to all the subscribers of the
                    project's mailing lists to vote. These are really
                    <em class="firstterm">polls</em> rather than votes, but the developers may
                    choose to treat the result as binding. As with any poll, be sure to
                    make it clear to the participants that there's a write-in option: if
                    someone thinks of a better option not offered in the poll questions,
                    her response may turn out to be the most important result of the
                    poll.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Vetoes">

                    <div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Some projects allow a special kind of vote known as a
                    <em class="firstterm">veto</em>. A veto is a way for a developer to put a
                    halt to a hasty or ill-considered change, at least long enough for
                    everyone to discuss it more. Think of a veto as somewhere between a
                    very strong objection and a filibuster. Its exact meaning varies from
                    one project to another. Some projects make it very difficult to
                    override a veto; others allow them to be overridden by regular
                    majority vote, perhaps after an enforced delay for more discussion.
                    Any veto should be accompanied by a thorough explanation; a veto
                    without such an explanation should be considered invalid on
                    arrival.</p>

                <p>With vetoes comes the problem of veto abuse. Sometimes
                    developers are too eager to raise the stakes of disagreement by
                    casting a veto, when
                    really all that was called for was more discussion. You can prevent
                    veto abuse by being very reluctant to use vetoes yourself, and by
                    gently calling it out when someone else uses her veto too often. If
                    necessary, you can also remind the group that vetoes are binding for
                    only as long as the group agrees they areâafter all, if a
                    clear majority of developers wants X, then X is going to happen one
                    way or another. Either the vetoing developer will back down, or the
                    group will decide to weaken the meaning of a veto.</p>

                <p>You may see people write "-1" to express a veto. This usage
                    originally comes from the Apache Software Foundation (which has a
                    highly structured voting and veto process, described at <a class="ulink"
                                                                               href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html"
                                                                               target="_top">apache.org/foundation/voting.html</a>),
                    but has since spread to
                    many other projects&nbsp;â&nbsp;albeit not always with exactly
                    the same formal meaning as at the ASF. Technically, "-1" does not
                    always indicate a formal veto even according to the Apache standards,
                    but informally it is usually taken to mean a veto, or at least a very
                    strong objection.</p>

                <p>Like votes, vetoes can apply retroactively. It's not okay to
                    object to a veto on the grounds that the change in question has
                    already been committed, or the action taken (unless it's something
                    irrevocable, like putting out a press release). On the other hand, a
                    veto that arrives weeks or months late isn't likely to be taken very
                    seriously, nor should it be.</p></div>

            <p>At some point, the number of conventions and agreements floating
                around in your project may become so great that you need to record it
                somewhere. In order to give such a document legitimacy, make it clear
                that it is based on mailing list discussions and on agreements already
                in effect. As you compose it, link to the relevant threads in the
                mailing list archives, and whenever there's a point you're not sure
                about, ask again. The document should not contain any surprises:
                remember, it
                is not the source of the agreements, it is merely a description of
                them. Of course, if it is successful, people will start citing it as
                a source of authority in itself, but that just means it reflects the
                overall will of the group accurately.</p>

                <div class="titlepage">

                        <div><p class="title"><b>Linking To Emails</b></p></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>When you link to an email thread in the archives, it's a good
                    practice to give not only the thread's URL, but the subject, sender
                    name, and date of the first message in the thread (or at least of some
                    message in the thread). The reason is that archives sometimes
                    move&nbsp;â&nbsp;surprisingly often,
                    actually&nbsp;â&nbsp;and the URL alone will usually not contain
                    enough information to find the message or thread in its new
                    location.</p>

                <p>The same advice could apply to bug tickets too, but in practice
                    bug trackers move less often than mail archives do, and when a bug
                    tracker moves the project usually manages to either preserve the
                    ticket numbers or make a mapping between old and new ticket numbers,
                    so that old references can be resolved with a little extra effort.
                    For various technical reasons, this is harder to do with emails and
                    especially with threads, so the better solution is just for references
                    to include enough information to do a search in the new archive if
                    necessary. See also <a class="xref" href="#using-archives" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">the
                        section called âConspicuous Use of Archivesâ</a>.</p></div>
            <p>This is the document alluded to in <a class="xref" href="#developer-guidelines"
                                                     title="Developer Guidelines">the section called âDeveloper
                Guidelinesâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>. Naturally, when the
                project is very young, you will have to lay down guidelines without
                the benefit of a long project history to draw on. But as the
                development community matures, you can adjust the language to reflect
                the way things actually turn out.</p>

            <p>Don't try to be comprehensive. No document can capture
                everything people need to know about participating in a project. Many
                of the conventions a project evolves remain forever unspoken, never
                mentioned explicitly, yet adhered to by all. Other things are simply
                too obvious to be mentioned, and would only distract from important
                but non-obvious material. For example, there's no point writing
                guidelines like "Be polite and respectful to others on the mailing
                lists, and don't start flame wars," or "Write clean, readable bug-free
                code." Of course these things are desirable, but since there's no
                conceivable universe in which they might <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
                desirable, they are not worth mentioning. If people are being rude on
                the mailing list, or writing buggy code, they're not going to stop
                just because the project guidelines said to. Such situations need to
                be dealt with as they arise, not by blanket admonitions to be good.
                On the other hand, if the project has specific guidelines about
                <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to write good code, such as rules about
                documenting every API in a certain format, then those guidelines
                should be written down as completely as possible.</p>

            <p>A good way to determine what to include is to base the document
                on the questions that newcomers ask most often, and on the complaints
                experienced developers make most often. This doesn't necessarily mean
                it should turn into a FAQ sheetâit probably needs a more
                coherent narrative structure than FAQs can offer. But it should
                follow the same reality-based principle of addressing the issues that
                actually arise, rather than those you anticipate might arise.</p>

            <p>If the project is a benevolent dictatorship, or has officers
                endowed with special powers (president, chair, whatever), then the
                document is also a good opportunity to codify succession procedures.
                Sometimes this can be as simple as naming specific people as
                replacements in case the BD suddenly leaves the project for any
                reason. Generally, if there is a BD, only the BD can get away with
                naming a successor. If there are elected officers, then the
                nomination and election procedure that was used to choose them in the
                first place should be described in the document. If there was no
                procedure originally, then get consensus on a procedure on the mailing
                lists <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> writing about it. People can
                sometimes be touchy about hierarchical structures, so the subject
                needs to be approached with sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most important thing is to make it clear that the
                rules can be reconsidered. If the conventions described in the
                document start to hamper the project, remind everyone that it is
                supposed to be a living reflection of the group's intentions, not a
                source of frustration and blockage. If someone makes a habit of
                inappropriately asking for rules to be reconsidered every time the
                rules get in her way, you don't always need to debate it with
                herâsometimes silence is the best tactic. If other people
                agree with the complaints, they'll chime in, and it will be obvious
                that something needs to change. If no one else agrees, then the
                person won't get much response, and the rules will stay as they
                are.</p>

                procedures more than development conventions. They're still worth
                reading, though, because they represent the accumulated experience of
                a lot of open source projects.</p></div>

            <p>Successful open source projects often get to a point where they
                feel the need for some sort of formal existence as a legal
                entity&nbsp;â&nbsp;to be able to accept donations (see
                <a class="xref" href="#money" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Money">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Money</i></a> for
                discussion of how to handle incoming
                funding), to purchase and maintain infrastructure for the project's
                benefit, to organize conferences and developer meetups, to enforce
                trademarks, etc.</p>

            <p>There may be a few exceptional circumstances where forming your
                own organization from scratch would be the right solution, but for
                most projects it is much better to join an existing organization.
                There are umbrella organizations whose purpose is to provide a legal
                home for open source projects. Working with multiple projects gives
                these organizations economies of scale and broad
                experience&nbsp;â&nbsp;any of them would almost certainly do a
                better job of providing services to your project than your project
                could manage if it started its own organization.</p>

            <p>These are all based in the United States, but there are similar
                umbrella organizations outside the U.S.&nbsp;â&nbsp;I just
                didn't know them well enough to make recommendations. If you're a
                U.S. reader, remember that the distinctions the U.S. tax code makes
                between different types of non-profit corporations, such as 501(c)(3)
                tax-exempt organizations vs 501(c)(6) trade associations, may not be
                meaningful to members of your project outside the U.S., and that the
                tax benefits available to donors under 501(c)(3) won't apply to
                non-U.S. donors anyway.</p>

            <p>If your project joins or creats a non-profit organization, make
                clear the separation between the legal infrastructure and the
                day-to-day running of the project. The organization is there to
                handle things the developers don't want to handle, not to interfere
                with the things the developers <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> want to handle
                and are already competent to handle. Even if the non-profit becomes
                the official owner of the project's copyrights, trademarks, and other
                assets, that shouldn't change the way decisions are made about
                technical questions, project direction, etc. One of the reasons to
                join one of the existing organizations is that they already have
                experience with this distinction, and know how to fairly read the will
                of the project even when there is controversy or strong disagreement.
                They also serve as a neutral place for resolving disagreements about
                how to allocate the project's money or other resources. More than one
                of the organizations above has had to play "project psychotherapist"
                on occasion, and their ability to do so should be considered an
                advantage even by a healthy and smoothly functioning project.</p></div>

            <p>This chapter examines how to use money constructively in a free
                software environment. It is aimed not only at developers who are paid
                to work on open source projects, but also at their managers (and even
                on up to the executives), who need to understand the social dynamics
                of the development environment and how money affects them.</p>

            <p>Sometimes people are surprised to learn that most free software
                is written by paid developers, not by volunteers. But when you think
                about it, it makes sense: a company often needs a particular piece of
                software to exist, and to be maintained and developed, and yet does
                not need a monopoly on that software. Lots of companies have web
                sites and therefore need a web server; far fewer companies need
                exclusive control over the development of their web server, or need to
                sell it on a proprietary basis. The same is true of office software
                suites, operating system kernels, network connectivity tools,
                educational programs, etc&nbsp;â&nbsp;just as historically it
                has been true of electric grids, roads, sewer systems, and other goods
                that everyone needs but no one needs to own. Just as we expect road
                workers to be paid, we should expect software developers to be paid as
                well.</p>

            <p>Even in the early days of free software, although the proportion
                of truly unpaid volunteers was certainly higher, there were also paid
                developers&nbsp;â&nbsp;and a good deal of informal subsidy as
                well, as there continues to be today. When a system administrator
                writes a network analysis tool to help her do her job, then posts it
                online and gets bug fixes and feature contributions from other system
                administrators, what's happened is that an unofficial consortium has
                been formed. The consortium's funding comes from the sysadmins'
                salaries, and its office space and network bandwidth are donated,
                albeit unknowingly, by the organizations they work for. Those
                organizations benefitted from the investment, of course, although they
                may not be institutionally aware of it at first.</p>

            <p>Today these efforts tend to be more formalized. Corporations
                have become conscious of the benefits of open source software, and now
                involve themselves directly in its development. Developers too have
                come to expect that really important projects will attract funding in
                one way or another. The question is just how the hierarchical command
                structures of corporations and the semi-decentralized, non-coercive
                communities of free software projects can work productively with each
                other&nbsp;â&nbsp;and more or less agree on what "productively"
                means.</p>

            <p>Financial backing is generally welcomed by open source
                development communities. Paid developers mean that bug reports are
                more likely to be listened to, that needed work is more likely to get
                done, and that the project will be less vulnerable to the Forces of
                Chaos (e.g., a key founding developer suddenly losing interest).
                After all, credibility is contagious, to a point. When, for example,
                Google backs an open source project, people assume the project will
                have the chance to succeed or fail on its merits, with adequate
                support in its early stages; their resultant willingness to devote
                effort to it can then make this a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

            <p>However, funding can also bring a perception of control. If not
                handled carefully, money can divide a project into in-group and
                out-group developers. If developers who aren't officially paid to
                work on the project get the feeling that design decisions or feature
                additions are simply available to the highest bidder, they'll head off
                to a project that seems more like a meritocracy and less like unpaid
                labor for someone else's benefit. They may never complain overtly on
                the mailing lists. Instead, there will simply be less and less noise
                from external sources, as the volunteers gradually stop trying to be
                taken seriously. The buzz of small-scale activity will continue, in
                the form of bug reports and occasional small fixes. But there won't
                be any large code contributions or outside participation in design
                discussions. People sense what's expected of them, and live up (or
                down) to those expectations.</p>

            <p>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
                can't buy influence. It most certainly can. The trick is that it
                can't buy influence directly. In a straightforward commercial
                transaction, you trade money for what you want. If you need a feature
                added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and (if all goes well) the
                work gets done and the feature eventually lands in the product. In an
                open source project, it's not so simple. You may sign a contract with
                some developers, but they'd be fooling themselvesâand
                youâif they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be
                accepted by the development community simply because you paid for it.
                The work can only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits
                into the community's vision for the software. You may have some say
                in that vision, but you won't be the only voice.</p>

            <p>So money can't purchase influence, but it can purchase things
                that <span class="emphasis"><em>lead to</em></span> influence. The most obvious example
                is programmers. If you hire good programmers, and they stick around
                long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
                community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
                any other member. They will have a vote, or if there are many of
                them, they will have a voting bloc. If they are respected in the
                project, they will have influence beyond just their votes. There is
                no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either. After
                all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
                reason. Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
                else's. It's just that the weight given to your company's goals will
                be determined by its representatives' status in the project, not by
                your company's size, budget, or business plan.<sup>[<a name="idp7381120" href="#ftn.idp7381120"

            <p>There are many different reasons open source projects get
                corporate support. This list is just a high-level survey. The items
                in it aren't mutually exclusive; often a project's financial backing
                will result from several, or even all, of these motivations:</p>

                    <dd><p>Separate organizations with related software needs often
                        find themselves duplicating effort, either by redundantly writing
                        similar code in-house, or by purchasing similar products from
                        proprietary vendors. When they realize what's going on, the
                        organizations may pool their resources and create (or join) an
                        open source project tailored to their needs. The advantages are
                        obvious: the costs of development are divided, but the benefits
                        accrue to all. Although this scenario might seem most intuitive for
                        nonprofits, it often makes strategic sense even for for-profit
                        competitors.</p></dd>

                        customers who want to resell it as part of a proprietary
                        application of their own, and simultaneously under a free license
                        for those willing to use it under open source terms (see <a class="xref" href="#dual-licensing">the
                            section called âProprietary Relicensing Schemesâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
                                                                                             title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10,
                            <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a></span>). If the open
                        source developer
                        community is active, the software gets the benefits of wide-area
                        debugging and development, yet the company still gets a royalty
                        stream to support some full-time programmers.</p>

                        <p>Dual-licensing is controversial because it is not a "pure
                            open source play" (as we say in business-speak), but rather yokes
                            funding for open source development to a monopoly-based revenue
                            stream. Whether this is a problem for you depends on where you
                            fall on the "open source is just a way of software development"
                            to "open source is a way of life" spectrum. The presence of
                            revenue from a proprietary version does not necessarily mean that
                            the free software version is worse off, and some very well-known
                            and widely-used free software has had corresponding proprietary
                            versions (<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL"
                                         target="_top">MySQL</a> is probably the most famous example). However,
                            some developers dislike the thought that their contributions may
                            end up in the proprietary version. Also, the mere presence of
                            the proprietary version suggests the possibility that some of the
                            best salaried developers' attention is going to the proprietary
                            code, not the open source code, and this can undermine other
                            developers' faith in the open source project.</p>

                        <p>None of is meant to persuade you not to do dual-licensing.
                            You should just be aware that dual-licensing strategies are
                            unlike the other business approaches I've listed here, and that
                            it probably requires more care and sophistication to manage

            <p>A funder's business model is not the only factor in how that
                funder relates to an open source community. The historical relationship
                between the two also matters: did the company start the project, or is
                it joining an existing development effort? In both cases, the funder
                will have to earn credibility, but, not surprisingly, there's a bit
                more earning to be done in the latter case. The organization needs to
                have clear goals with respect to the project. Is the company trying
                to keep a position of leadership, or simply trying to be one voice in
                the community, to guide but not necessarily govern the project's
                direction? Or does it just want to have a couple of committers
                around, able to fix customers' bugs and get the changes into the
                public distribution without any fuss?</p>

            <p>Keep these questions in mind as you read the guidelines that
                follow. They are meant to apply to any sort of organizational
                involvement in a free software project, but every project is a human
                environment, and therefore no two are exactly alike. To some degree,
                you will always have to play by ear, but following these principles
                will increase the likelihood of things turning out the way you
                want.</p></div>

            <p>If you're managing programmers on an open source project, keep
                them there long enough that they acquire both technical and political
                expertiseâa couple of years, at a minimum. Of course, no
                project, whether open or closed-source, benefits from swapping
                programmers in and out too often. The need for a newcomer to learn
                the ropes each time would be a deterrent in any environment. But the
                penalty is even stronger in open source projects, because outgoing
                developers take with them not only their knowledge of the code, but
                also their status in the community and the human relationships they
                have made there.</p>

            <p>The credibility a developer has accumulated cannot be
                transferred. To pick the most obvious example, an incoming developer
                can't inherit commit access from an outgoing one (see
                <a class="xref" href="#money-vs-love" title="Money Can't Buy You Love">the section called âMoney Can't
                    Buy You Loveâ</a> later in this chapter), so if the
                new developer doesn't already have commit access, he will have to
                submit patches until he does. But commit access is only the most
                easily quantifiable manifestation of lost influence. A long-time developer
                also knows all the old arguments that have been hashed and rehashed on
                the discussion lists. A new developer, having no memory of those
                conversations, may try to raise the topics again, leading to a loss of
                credibility for your organization; the others might wonder "Can't
                they remember anything?" A new developer will also have no political
                feel for the project's personalities, and will not be able to
                influence development directions as quickly or as smoothly as one
                who's been around a long time.</p>

            <p>Train newcomers through a program of supervised engagement. The
                new developer should be in direct contact with the public development
                community from the very first day, starting off with bug fixes and
                cleanup tasks, so he can learn the code base and acquire a reputation
                in the community, yet not spark any long and involved design
                discussions. All the while, one or more experienced developers should
                be available for questioning, and should be reading every post the
                newcomer makes to the development lists, even if they're in threads
                that the experienced developers normally wouldn't pay attention to.
                This will help the group spot potential rocks before the newcomer runs
                aground. Private, behind-the-scenes encouragement and pointers can
                also help a lot, especially if the newcomer is not accustomed to
                massively parallel peer review of his code.</p>

                <p>At CollabNet, when we hired a new developer to work on
                    Subversion, we would sit down together and pick some open bugs for the
                    new person to cut his teeth on. We'll discuss the technical outlines
                    of the solutions, and then assign at least one experienced developer
                    to (publicly) review the patches that the new developer would (also
                    publicly) post. We typically didn't even look at the patch before the
                    main development list saw it, although we could if there were some
                    reason to. The important thing is that the new developer go through
                    the process of public review, learning the code base while
                    simultaneously becoming accustomed to receiving critiques from
                    complete strangers. But we also tried to coordinate the timing so
                    that our own review came immediately after the posting of the patch.
                    That way the first review the list sees is ours, which can help set
                    the tone for the others' reviews. It also contributes to the idea
                    that this new person is to be taken seriously: if others see that
                    we're putting in the time to give detailed reviews, with thorough
                    explanations and references into the archives where appropriate,
                    they'll appreciate that a form of training is going on, and that it
                    probably signifies a long-term investment. This can make them more
                    positively disposed toward the developer, to the degree of spending a
                    little extra time answering questions and reviewing patches
                    themselves.</p></div>

            <p>Your developers should strive to appear in the project's public
                forums as individual participants, rather than as a monolithic
                corporate presence. This is not because there is some negative
                connotation inherent in monolithic corporate presences (well, perhaps
                there is, but that's not what this book is about). Rather, it's
                because individuals are the only sort of entity open source projects
                are structurally equipped to deal with. An individual contributor can
                have discussions, submit patches, acquire credibility, vote, and so
                forth. A company cannot.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, by behaving in a decentralized manner, you avoid
                stimulating centralization of opposition. Let your developers
                disagree with each other on the mailing lists. Encourage them to
                review each other's code as often, and as publicly, as they would
                anyone else's. Discourage them from always voting as a bloc, because
                if they do, others may start to feel that, just on general principles,
                there should be an organized effort to keep them in check.</p>

            <p>There's a difference between actually being decentralized and
                simply striving to appear that way. Under certain circumstances,
                having your developers behave in concert can be quite useful, and they
                should be prepared to coordinate behind the scenes when necessary.
                For example, when making a proposal, having several people chime in
                with agreement early on can help it along, by giving the impression of
                a growing consensus. Others will feel that the proposal has momentum,
                and that if they were to object, they'd be stopping that momentum.
                Thus, people will object only if they have a good reason to do so.
                There's nothing wrong with orchestrating agreement like this, as long
                as objections are still taken seriously. The public manifestations of
                a private agreement are no less sincere for having been coordinated
                beforehand, and are not harmful as long as they are not used to
                prejudicially snuff out opposing arguments. Their purpose is merely
                to inhibit the sort of people who like to object just to stay in
                shape; see <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">the

            <p>Be as open about your organization's goals as you can without
                compromising business secrets. If you want the project to acquire a
                certain feature because, say, your customers have been clamoring for
                it, just say so outright on the mailing lists. If the customers wish
                to remain anonymous, as is sometimes the case, then at least ask them
                if they can be used as unnamed examples. The more the public
                development community knows about <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you want
                what you want, the more comfortable they'll be with whatever you're
                proposing.</p>

            <p>This runs counter to the instinctâso easy to acquire, so
                hard to shake offâthat knowledge is power, and that the more
                others know about your goals, the more control they have over you.
                But that instinct would be wrong here. By publicly advocating the
                feature (or bugfix, or whatever it is), you have
                <span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> laid your cards on the table. The only
                question now is whether you will succeed in guiding the community to
                share your goal. If you merely state that you want it, but can't
                provide concrete examples of why, your argument is weak, and people
                will start to suspect a hidden agenda. But if you give just a few
                real-world scenarios showing why the proposed feature is important,
                that can have a dramatic effect on the debate.</p>

            <p>To see why this is so, consider the alternative. Too
                frequently, debates about new features or new directions are long and
                tiresome. The arguments people advance often reduce to "I personally
                want X," or the ever-popular "In my years of experience as a software
                designer, X is extremely important to users" or "...is a useless frill
                that will please no one." Predictably, the absence of real-world usage
                data neither shortens nor tempers such debates, but instead allows
                them to drift farther and farther from any mooring in actual user
                experience. Without some countervailing force, the end result is
                likely to be determined by whoever was the most articulate, or
                the most persistent, or the most senior.</p>

            <p>As an organization with plentiful customer data available, you
                have the opportunity to provide just such a countervailing force. You
                can be a conduit for information that might otherwise have no means of
                reaching the development community. The fact that the information
                supports your desires is nothing to be embarrassed about. Most
                developers don't individually have very broad experience with how the
                software they write is used. Each developer uses the software in
                her own idiosyncratic way; as far as other usage patterns go, she's
                relying on intuition and guesswork, and deep down, she knows
                this. By providing credible data about a significant number of users,
                you are giving the public development community something akin to
                oxygen. As long as you present it right, they will welcome it
                enthusiastically, and it will propel things in the direction you want
                to go.</p>

            <p>The key, of course, is presenting it right. It will never do to
                insist that simply because you deal with a large number of users, and
                because they need (or think they need) a given feature, therefore
                your solution ought to be implemented. Instead, you should focus your
                initial posts on the problem, rather than on one particular solution.
                Describe in great detail the experiences your customers are
                encountering, offer as much analysis as you have available, and as
                many reasonable solutions as you can think of. When people start
                speculating about the effectiveness of various solutions, you can
                continue to draw on your data to support or refute what they say. You
                may have one particular solution in mind all along, but don't single
                it out for special consideration at first. This is not deception, it
                is simply standard "honest broker" behavior. After all, your true
                goal is to solve the problem; a solution is merely a means to that
                end. If the solution you prefer really is superior, other developers
                will recognize that on their own eventuallyâand then they will
                get behind it of their own free will, which is much better than you
                browbeating them into implementing it. (There is also the possibility
                that they will think of a better solution.)</p>

            <p>This is not to say that you can't ever come out in favor of a
                specific solution. But you must have the patience to see the analysis
                you've already done internally repeated on the public development
                lists. Don't post saying "Yes, we've been over all that here, but it
                doesn't work for reasons A, B, and C. When you get right down to it,
                the only way to solve this is Q." The problem is not so much that it
                sounds arrogant as that it gives the impression that you have
                <span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> devoted some unknown (but, people will
                presume, large) amount of analytical resources to the problem, behind
                closed doors. It makes it seem as though efforts have been going on,
                and perhaps decisions made, that the public is not privy toâand
                that is a recipe for resentment.</p>

            <p>Naturally, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> know how much effort you've
                devoted to the problem internally, and that knowledge is, in a way, a
                disadvantage. It puts your developers in a slightly different mental
                space than everyone else on the mailing lists, reducing their ability
                to see things from the point of view of those who haven't yet thought
                about the problem as much. The earlier you can get everyone else
                thinking about things in the same terms as you do, the smaller this
                distancing effect will be. This logic applies not only to individual
                technical situations, but to the broader mandate of making your goals
                as clear as you can. The unknown is always more destabilizing than
                the known. If people understand why you want what you want, they'll
                feel comfortable talking to you even when they disagree. If they
                can't figure out what makes you tick, they'll assume the worst, at
                least some of the time.</p>

            <p>You won't be able to publicize everything, of course, and people
                won't expect you to. All organizations have secrets; perhaps
                for-profits have more of them, but nonprofits have them too. If you
                must advocate a certain course, but can't reveal anything about why,
                then simply offer the best arguments you can under that handicap, and
                accept the fact that you may not have as much influence as you want in
                the discussion. This is one of the compromises you make in order to
                have a development community not on your payroll.</p></div>

            <p>If you're a paid developer on a project, then set guidelines
                early on about what the money can and cannot buy. This does not mean
                you need to post twice a day to the mailing lists reiterating your
                noble and incorruptible nature. It merely means that you should be on
                the lookout for opportunities to defuse the tensions that
                <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be created by money. You don't need to
                start out assuming that the tensions are there; you do need to
                demonstrate an awareness that they have the potential to arise.</p>

            <p>A perfect example of this came up early in the Subversion project.
                Subversion was started in 2000 by <a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/"
                                                     target="_top">CollabNet</a>, which has been the
                project's primary funder since its inception, paying the salaries of
                several developers (disclaimer: I'm one of them). Soon after the
                project began, we hired another developer, Mike Pilato, to join the
                effort. By then, coding had already started. Although Subversion was
                still very much in the early stages, it already had a development
                community with a set of basic ground rules.</p>

            <p>Mike's arrival raised an interesting question. Subversion
                already had a policy about how a new developer gets commit access.
                First, he submits some patches to the development mailing list. After
                enough patches have gone by for the other committers to see that the
                new contributor knows what he's doing, someone proposes that he just
                commit directly (that proposal is private, as described in <a class="xref" href="#committers"
                                                                              title="Committers">the section called
                    âCommittersâ</a>). Assuming the committers agree, one of
                them mails the new developer and offers him direct commit access to
                the project's repository.</p>

            <p>CollabNet had hired Mike specifically to work on Subversion.
                Among those who already knew him, there was no doubt about his coding
                skills or his readiness to work on the project. Furthermore, the
                volunteer developers had a very good relationship with the CollabNet
                employees, and most likely would not have objected if we'd just given
                Mike commit access the day he was hired. But we knew we'd be setting
                a precedent. If we granted Mike commit access by fiat, we'd be saying
                that CollabNet had the right to ignore project guidelines, simply
                because it was the primary funder. While the damage from this would
                not necessarily be immediately apparent, it would gradually result in
                the non-salaried developers feeling disenfranchised. Other people
                have to earn their commit accessâCollabNet just buys
                it.</p>

            <p>So Mike agreed to start out his employment at CollabNet like any
                other volunteer developer, without commit access. He sent patches to
                the public mailing list, where they could be, and were, reviewed by
                everyone. We also said on the list that we were doing things this way
                deliberately, so there could be no missing the point. After a couple
                of weeks of solid activity by Mike, someone (I can't remember if it
                was a CollabNet developer or not) proposed him for commit access, and
                he was accepted, as we knew he would be.</p>

            <p>That kind of consistency gets you a credibility that money could
                never buy. And credibility is a valuable currency to have in
                technical discussions: it's immunization against having one's motives
                questioned later. In the heat of argument, people will sometimes look
                for non-technical ways to win the battle. The project's primary
                funder, because of its deep involvement and obvious concern over the
                directions the project takes, presents a wider target than most. By
                being scrupulous to observe all project guidelines right from the
                start, the funder makes itself the same size as everyone else.</p>

                titleâand in the blog entry, she describes how the Tomcat
                development community got Sun to hold its own developers to the same
                commit-access standards as the non-Sun developers.)</p>

            <p>The need for the funders to play by the same rules as everyone
                else means that the Benevolent Dictatorship governance model (see
                <a class="xref" href="#benevolent-dictator" title="Benevolent Dictators">the section called âBenevolent
                    Dictatorsâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>) is slightly
                harder to pull
                off in the presence of funding, particularly if the dictator works for
                the primary funder. Since a dictatorship has few rules, it is hard
                for the funder to prove that it's abiding by community standards, even
                when it is. It's certainly not impossible; it just requires a project
                leader who is able to see things from the point of view of the outside
                developers, as well as that of the funder, and act accordingly. Even
                then, it's probably a good idea to have a proposal for non-dictatorial
                governance sitting in your back pocket, ready to be brought out the
                moment there are any indications of widespread dissatisfaction in the
                community.</p></div>
        <div class="sect1" title="Contracting">
            <div class="titlepage">

                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="contracting"></a>Contracting</h2></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Contracted work needs to be handled carefully in free software
                projects. Ideally, if you hire a contractor you want her work to be
                accepted by the community and folded into the public distribution. In
                theory, it wouldn't matter who the contractor is, as long as her work
                is good and meets the project's guidelines. Theory and practice can
                sometimes match, too: a complete stranger who shows up with a good
                patch <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> generally be able to get it into the
                software. The trouble is, it's very hard to produce an acceptable
                patch for a non-trivial enhancement or new feature while truly being a
                complete stranger; one must first discuss it with the rest of the
                project. The duration of that discussion cannot be precisely
                predicted. If the contractor is paid by the hour, you may end up
                paying more than you expected; if she is paid a flat sum, she may end
                up doing more work than she can afford.</p>

            <p>There are two ways around this. The preferred way is to make an
                educated guess about the length of the discussion process, based on
                past experience, add in some padding for error, and base the contract
                on that. It also helps to divide the problem into as many small,
                independent chunks as possible, to increase the predictability of each
                chunk. The other way is to contract solely for delivery of a patch,
                and treat the patch's acceptance into the public project as a separate
                matter. Then it becomes much easier to write the contract, but you're
                stuck with the burden of maintaining a private patch for either as
                long as you depend on the software or for as long as it takes you to
                get that patch into the upstream codebase.</p>

            <p>Even with the preferred way, the contract itself cannot require
                that the patch be accepted by the upstream project, because that would
                involve selling something that's not for sale. (What if the rest of
                the project unexpectedly decides not to support the feature?)
                However, the contract can require a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">bona
                    fide</em></span> effort to get the change accepted by the
                community, and that it be committed to the repository if the community
                agrees with it. For example, if the project has written standards
                (e.g., about coding conventions, documentation, writing regression
                tests, submitting patches, etc), the contract can reference those
                standards and specify that the contracted work must meet them. In
                practice, this usually works out the way everyone hopes.</p>

            <p>The best tactic for successful contracting is to hire one of the
                project's developersâpreferably a committerâas the
                contractor. This may seem like a form of purchasing influence, and,
                well, it is. But it's not as corrupt as it might seem. A developer's
                influence in the project is due mainly to the quality of her code and
                to her interactions with other developers. The fact that she has a
                contract to get certain things done doesn't raise her status in any
                way, and doesn't lower it either, though it may make people scrutinize
                her more carefully. Most developers would not risk their long-term
                position in the project by backing an inappropriate or widely disliked
                new feature. In fact, part of what you get, or should get, when you
                hire such a contractor is advice about what sorts of changes are
                likely to be accepted by the community. You also get a slight shift
                in the project's priorities. Because prioritization is just a matter
                of who has time to work on what, when you pay for someone's time, you
                cause their work to move up in the priority queue a bit. This is a
                well-understood fact of life among experienced open source developers,
                and at least some of them will devote attention to the contractor's
                work simply because it looks like it's going to <span class="emphasis"><em>get
                    done</em></span>, so they want to help it get done right. Perhaps they
                won't write any of the code, but they'll still discuss the design and
                review the code, both of which can be very useful. For all these
                reasons, the contractor is best drawn from the ranks of those already
                involved with the project.</p>

            <p>This immediately raises two questions: Should contracts ever be
                private? And when they're not, should you worry about creating
                tensions in the community by the fact that you've contracted with some
                developers and not others?</p>

            <p>It's best to be open about contracts when you can. Otherwise,
                the contractor's behavior may seem strange to others in the
                communityâperhaps she's suddenly giving inexplicably high
                priority to features she's never shown interest in the past. When
                people ask her why she wants them now, how can she answer convincingly
                if she can't talk about the fact that she's been contracted to write
                them?</p>

            <p>At the same time, neither you nor the contractor should act as
                though others should treat your arrangement as a big deal. Too often
                I've seen contractors waltz onto a development list with the attitude
                that their posts should be taken more seriously simply because they're
                being paid. That kind of attitude signals to the rest of the project
                that the contractor regards the fact of the contractâas opposed
                to the code <span class="emphasis"><em>resulting</em></span> from the contractâto
                be the important thing. But from the other developers' point of view,
                only the code matters. At all times, the focus of attention should be
                kept on technical issues, not on the details of who is paying whom.
                For example, one of the developers in the Subversion community handles
                contracting in a particularly graceful way. While discussing his code
                changes in IRC, he'll mention as an aside (often in a private remark,
                an IRC <em class="firstterm">privmsg</em>, to one of the other committers)
                that he's being paid for his work on this particular bug or feature.
                But he also consistently gives the impression that he'd want to be
                working on that change anyway, and that he's happy the money is making
                it possible for him to do that. He may or may not reveal his
                customer's identity, but in any case he doesn't dwell on the contract.
                His remarks about it are just an ornament to an otherwise technical
                discussion about how to get something done.</p>

            <p>That example shows another reason why it's good to be open about
                contracts. There may be multiple organizations sponsoring contracts
                on a given open source project, and if each knows what the others are
                trying to do, they may be able to pool their resources. In the above
                case, the project's largest funder (CollabNet) was not involved with
                these piecework contracts, but knowing that someone else was
                sponsoring certain bug fixes allowed CollabNet to redirect its
                resources to other bugs, resulting in greater efficiency for the
                project as a whole.</p>

            <p>Will other developers resent that some are paid for working on
                the project? In general, no, particularly when those who are paid are
                established, well-respected members of the community anyway. No one
                expects contract work to be distributed equally among all the
                committers. People understand the importance of long-term
                relationships: the uncertainties involved in contracting are such that
                once you find someone you can work reliably with, you would be
                reluctant to switch to a different person just for the sake of
                evenhandedness. Think of it this way: the first time you hire, there
                will be no complaints, because clearly you had to pick
                <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span>âit's not your fault you can't hire
                everyone. Later, when you hire the same person a second time, that's
                just common sense: you already know her, the last time was
                successful, so why take unnecessary risks? Thus, it's perfectly
                natural to have a few go-to people in the community, instead of
                spreading the work around evenly.</p>

                    must be considered part of the work, and fully embraced by the
                    contractor. Don't think of community scrutiny as an obstacle to be
                    overcomeâthink of it as a free design board and QA department.
                    It is a benefit to be aggressively pursued, not merely endured.</p>

                    <p>In 1995, I was one half of a partnership that provided support
                        and enhancements for CVS (the Concurrent Versions System; see <a class="ulink"
                                                                                         href="http://nongnu.org/cvs"
                                                                                         target="_top">nongnu.org/cvs</a>).
                        My partner Jim
                        Blandy and I were, informally, the maintainers of CVS by that point. But
                        we'd never thought carefully about how we ought to relate to the
                        existing mostly part-time and volunteer CVS development community. We
                        just assumed that they'd send in patches, and we'd apply them, and
                        that was pretty much how it worked.</p>

                    <p>Back then, networked CVS could be done only over a remote login
                        program such as <code class="literal">rsh</code>. Using the same password for
                        CVS access as for login access was an obvious security risk, and many
                        organizations were put off by it. A major investment bank hired us to
                        add a new authentication mechanism, so they could safely use networked
                        CVS with their remote offices.</p>

                    <p>Jim and I took the contract and sat down to design the new
                        authentication system. What we came up with was pretty simple (the
                        United States had export controls on cryptographic code at the time,
                        so the customer understood that we couldn't implement strong
                        authentication), but as we were not experienced in designing such
                        protocols, we still made a few gaffes that would have been obvious to
                        an expert. These mistakes would easily have been caught had we taken
                        the time to write up a proposal and run it by the other developers for
                        review. But we never did so, because it didn't occur to us to think
                        of the development list as a resource to be used to improve our
                        contracted work. We knew that people
                        were probably going to accept whatever we committed, andâbecause
                        we didn't know what we didn't knowâwe didn't bother to do the
                        work in a visible way, e.g., posting patches frequently, making small,
                        easily digestible commits to a special branch, etc. The resulting
                        authentication protocol was not very good, and of course, once it
                        became established, it was difficult to improve, because of
                        compatibility concerns.</p>

                    <p>The root of the problem was not lack of experience; we could
                        easily have learned what we needed to know. The problem was our
                        attitude toward the volunteer development community. We regarded
                        acceptance of the changes as a hurdle to leap, rather than as a
                        process by which the quality of the changes could be improved. Since
                        we were confident that almost anything we did would be accepted (as it
                        was), we made little effort to get others involved.</p></div>
                <p>Obviously, when you're choosing a contractor, you want someone
                    with the right technical skills and experience for the job. But it's
                    also important to choose someone with a track record of constructive
                    interaction with the other developers in the community. That way
                    you're getting more than just a single person; you're getting an agent
                    who will be able to draw on a network of expertise to make sure the
                    work is done in a robust and maintainable way.</p></div>

            </div>
            <p>Programming is only part of the work that goes on in an open
                source project. From the point of view of the project's volunteers,
                it's the most visible and glamorous part. This unfortunately means
                that other activities, such as documentation, formal testing, etc., can
                sometimes be neglected, at least compared to the amount of attention
                they often receive in proprietary software. Corporate organizations
                are sometimes able to make up for this, by devoting some of their
                internal software development infrastructure to open source
                projects.</p>

            <p>The key to doing this successfully is to translate between the
                company's internal processes and those of the public development
                community. Such translation is not effortless: often the two are not
                a close match, and the differences can only be bridged via human
                intervention. For example, the company may use a different bug
                tracker than the public project. Even if they use the same tracking
                software, the data stored in it will be very different, because the
                bug-tracking needs of a company are very different from those of a
                free software community. A piece of information that starts in one
                tracker may need to be reflected in the other, with confidential
                portions removed or, in the other direction, added.</p>

            <p>The sections that follow are about how to build and maintain
                such bridges. The end result should be that the open source project
                runs more smoothly, the community recognizes the company's investment
                of resources, and yet does not feel that the company is
                inappropriately steering things toward its own goals.</p>

                <a name="subsidize-qa"></a>

                <p>In proprietary software development, it is normal to have teams
                    of people dedicated solely to quality assurance: bug hunting,
                    performance and scalability testing, interface and documentation
                    checking, etc. As a rule, these activities are not pursued as
                    vigorously by the volunteer community on a free software project.
                    This is partly because it's hard to get volunteer labor for
                    unglamorous work like testing, partly because people tend to assume
                    that having a large user community gives the project good testing
                    coverage, and, in the case of performance and scalability testing,
                    partly because volunteers often don't have access to the necessary
                    hardware resources anyway.</p>

                <p>The assumption that having many users is equivalent to having
                    many testers is not entirely baseless. Certainly there's little point
                    assigning testers for basic functionality in common environments: bugs
                    there will quickly be found by users in the natural course of things.
                    But because users are just trying to get work done, they do not
                    consciously set out to explore uncharted edge cases in the program's
                    functionality, and are likely to leave certain classes of bugs
                    unfound. Furthermore, when they discover a bug with an easy
                    workaround, they often silently implement the workaround without
                    bothering to report the bug. Most insidiously, the usage patterns of
                    your customers (the people who drive <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
                    interest in the software) may differ in statistically significant ways
                    from the usage patterns of the Average User In The Street.</p>

                <p>A professional testing team can uncover these sorts of bugs, and
                    can do so as easily with free software as with proprietary software.
                    The challenge is to convey the testing team's results back to the
                    public in a useful form. In-house testing departments usually have
                    their own way of reporting test results to their own developers,
                    involving company-specific
                    jargon, or specialized knowledge about particular customers and their
                    data sets. Such reports would be inappropriate for the public bug
                    tracker, both because of their form and because of confidentiality
                    concerns. Even if your company's internal bug tracking software
                    were the same as that used by the public project, management might
                    need to make company-specific comments and metadata changes to the
                    tickets (for example, to raise an ticket's internal priority, or
                    schedule its resolution for a particular customer). Usually such
                    notes are confidentialâsometimes they're not even shown to the
                    customer. But even when they're not confidential, they're not very
                    helpful to the public project.</p>

                <p>Yet the core bug report itself <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important
                    to the public. In fact, a bug report from your testing department is
                    in some ways more valuable than one received from users at large,
                    since the testing department probes for things that other users won't.
                    Given that you're unlikely to get that particular bug report from any
                    other source, you definitely want to preserve it and make it
                    available to the public project.</p>

                <p>To do this, either the QA department can file tickets directly in
                    the public ticket tracker, if they're comfortable with that, or an
                    intermediary (usually one of the developers) can "translate" the
                    testing department's internal reports into new tickets in the public
                    tracker. Translation simply means describing the bug in a way that
                    makes no reference to customer-specific information (the reproduction
                    recipe may use customer data, assuming the customer approves it, of
                    course).</p>

                <p>It is definitely preferable to have the QA department filing
                    tickets in the public tracker directly. That gives the public a more
                    direct appreciation of your company's involvement with the project:
                    useful bug reports add to your organization's credibility just as any
                    technical contribution would. It also gives developers a direct line
                    of communication to the testing team. For example, if the internal QA
                    team is monitoring the public ticket tracker, a developer can commit a
                    fix for a scalability bug (which the developer may not have the
                    resources to test herself), and then add a note to the ticket asking
                    the QA team to see if the fix had the desired effect. Expect a bit of
                    resistance from some of the developers; programmers have a tendency to
                    regard QA as, at best, a necessary evil. The QA team can easily
                    overcome this by finding significant bugs and filing comprehensible
                    reports; on the other hand, if their reports are not at least as good
                    as those coming from the regular user community, then there's no point
                    having them interact directly with the development team.</p>

                <p>Either way, once a public ticket exists, the original internal
                    ticket should simply reference the public ticket for technical content.
                    Management and paid developers may continue to annotate the internal
                    ticket with company-specific comments as necessary, but use the public
                    ticket for information that should be available to everyone.</p>

                <p>You should go into this process expecting extra overhead.
                    Maintaining two tickets for one bug is, naturally, more work than
                    maintaining one ticket. The benefit is that many more coders will see
                    the report and be able to contribute to a solution.</p></div>

                <p>Corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, are almost the only
                    entities that ever pay attention to complex legal issues in free
                    software. Individual developers often understand the nuances of
                    various open source licenses, but they generally do not have the time
                    or resources to competently handle legal issues themselves. If your
                    company has a legal department, it can help a project by assisting
                    with trademark issues, copyright license ownership and compatibility
                    questions, defense against patent trolls, etc. If the project decides
                    to organize formally, or to join an existing umbrella organization,
                    your legal department can help with issues of corporate law, asset
                    transfer, reviewing agreements, and other due diligence
                    matters.</p>

                <p>Some more concrete ideas of what sorts of legal help might be
                    useful are discussed in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
                                               title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10,
                        <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a>. The main thing is to
                    make sure that communications between the legal department and the
                    development community, if they happen at all, happen with a mutual
                    appreciation of the very different universes the parties are coming
                    from. On occasion, these two groups talk past each other, each side
                    assuming domain-specific knowledge that the other does not have. A
                    good strategy is to have a liaison (usually a developer, or else a
                    lawyer with technical expertise) stand in the middle and translate for
                    as long as needed.</p></div>

                        </h3></div>

                </div>
                <a name="subsidize-documentation-usability"></a>

                <p>Documentation and usability are both famous weak spots in open
                    source projects, although I think, at least in the case of
                    documentation, that the difference between free and proprietary
                    software is frequently exaggerated. Nevertheless, it is empirically
                    true that much open source software lacks first-class documentation
                    and usability research.</p>

                <p>If your organization wants to help fill these gaps for a
                    project, probably the best thing it can do is hire people who
                    are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> regular developers on the project, but
                    who will be able to interact productively with the developers.
                    Not hiring regular developers is good for two reasons: one, that way
                    you don't take development time away from the project; two, those
                    closest to the software are usually the wrong people to write
                    documentation or investigate usability anyway, because they have
                    trouble seeing the software from an outsider's point of view.</p>

                <p>However, it will still be necessary for whoever works on these
                    problems to communicate with the developers. Find people who are
                    technical enough to talk to the coding team, but not so expert in the
                    software that they can't empathize with regular users anymore.</p>

                <p>A medium-level user is probably the right person to write good
                    documentation. In fact, after the first edition of this book was
                    published, I received the following email from an open source
                    developer named Dirk Reiners:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>One comment on Money::Documentation and Usability: when we had
                        some
                        money to spend and decided that a beginner's tutorial was the most
                        critical piece that we needed we hired a medium-level user to write it.
                        He had gone through the induction to the system recently enough to
                        remember the problems, but he had gotten past them so he knew how to
                        describe them. That allowed him to write something that needed only
                        minor fixes by the core developers for the things that he hadn't gotten
                        right, but still covering the 'obvious' stuff devs would have missed.</p>

                        <p>His case was even better, as it had been his job to introduce a bunch of
                            other people (students) to the system, so he combined the experience of
                            many people, which is something that was just a lucky occurrence and is
                            probably hard to get in most cases.</p></blockquote>

                    <p>The field of user experience (<em class="firstterm">UX</em>) design
                        has lately (as of this writing in early 2014) begun to acquire a new
                        seriousness of purpose and consistency of professional standards.
                        Naturally, one thing many companies think of when they want to help
                        improve an open source project is to fund UX work, since that's just
                        the sort of thing that projects often overlook or, in some cases,
                        don't even know they need.</p>

                    <p>As with many other types of engagement, do not assume that a UX
                        expert can be parachuted into the project. User experience design is
                        not a checkbox. It is an attitude taken by a team throughout
                        development, and one of the primary qualifications to look for in UX
                        contractors is their ability to gain long-term credibility with the
                        developers, and to help developers pay attention to user experience
                        goals. For example, in addition to their innate domain knowledge, UX
                        designers often know how to set up and incorporate feedback from user
                        trials&nbsp;â&nbsp;but those trials will only be effective if
                        the results are presented to the development team in a way that makes
                        it easy for the developers to take the results seriously. This can
                        only happen through a sustained, two-way interaction, in which UX
                        experts are subscribed to the appropriate project forums and take the
                        attitude that they are a kind of specialized developer on the project,
                        rather than an outside expert providing advice. Use UX experts who
                        have worked with open source projects before, if possible.</p></div>

                    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) for open source
                    projects has meant that it is increasingly unnecessary for projects to
                    get corporate support for basic project-hosting infrastructure. It
                    still happens sometimes, usually in cases where the company itself
                    started the project, and is trying to create or keep an association in
                    the public's mind between the project and the company. The most
                    common technique for creating this association is for the company to
                    host the project's resources under the company's domain name, thus
                    getting association through the project's URLs.</p>

                <p>While this will cause most users to think of the software as
                    having <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> to do with your company, it can
                    also cause a problem: developers are aware of this associative
                    tendency too, and may not be very comfortable with having the project
                    hosted under your domain unless you're seriously contributing to the
                    projectânot just bandwidth and server space, but significant
                    amounts of development time. After all, there are a lot of free
                    places to host these days. The community may eventually feel that the
                    implied misallocation of credit is not worth the minor convenience
                    brought by donated hosting, and may even attempt to take the project
                    elsewhere. So if you want to provide hosting, do soâbut if you
                    are actually trying to create a public association between your
                    company and the project, make sure that the level of support you
                    provide is matched to the amount of credit you claim, whether you
                    claim it via URL, banner ads, or some other means.</p></div>

                <p>Many projects have infrastructure needs beyond just hosting of
                    code, bug tracker, etc. For example, projects often use
                    <em class="firstterm">continuous integration</em> (CI) testing
                    (a.k.a. <em class="firstterm">build farms</em>) to automatically ensure
                    that the changes developers are committing both integrate into the
                    mainline trunk and pass all regression tests<sup>[<a name="idp7546128" href="#ftn.idp7546128"
                                                                         class="footnote">45</a>]</sup>.
                    However, depending on the size and complexity of the codebase, the
                    number of developers checking in changes, and other factors, running a
                    responsive build farm can cost more money than any individual
                    developer has at their disposal. A good way to help, and gain some
                    goodwill in the process, is to donate the server space and bandwith
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the technical expertise to set up the
                    continuous integration and automated testing. If you don't have the
                    technical expertise available on staff, you could hire someone from
                    the project to do it, or at the very least give some of the project's
                    developers administrative access to the CI servers so they can set
                    things up themselves.</p></div>

            <p>Although most open source developers would probably hate to

                create buzz around an open source product, even to the point where
                hardheaded coders find themselves having vaguely positive thoughts
                about the software for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.
                It is not my purpose here to dissect the arms-race dynamics of marketing
                in general. Any corporation involved in free software will eventually
                find itself considering how to market themselves, the software, or

                    before making them, and give the public the means to check your claims

                    Internet access and the right social contacts to publicize their
                    findings in a damaging way, should they choose to. When Global
                    Megacorp Chemical Industries pollutes a stream, that's verifiable, but
                    only by trained scientists, who can then be refuted by Global
                    Megacorp's scientists, leaving the public scratching their heads and
                    wondering what to think. On the other hand, your behavior in the open
                    source world is not only visible and recorded, it is also easy for
                    many people to check it independently, come to their own conclusions,
                    and spread those conclusions by word of mouth. These communications
                    networks are already in place; they are the essence of how open source
                    operates, and they can be used to transmit any sort of information.
                    Refutation is usually difficult, if not impossibleâespecially
                    when what people are saying is true.</p>

                <p>For example, it's okay to refer to your organization as having
                    "founded project X" if you really did. But don't refer to yourself as
                    the "makers of X" if most of the code was written by outsiders.
                    Conversely, don't claim to have a deeply involved volunteer developer
                    community if anyone can look at your repository and see that there are
                    few or no code changes coming from outside your organization.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Once I saw an announcement by a very well-known computer
                        company, stating that they were releasing an important software
                        package under an open source license. When the initial announcement
                        came out, I took a look at their now-public version control repository
                        and saw that it contained only three revisions. In other words, they
                        had done an initial import of the source code, but hardly anything had
                        happened since then. That in itself was not worryingâthey'd
                        just made the announcement, after all. There was no reason to expect
                        a lot of development activity right away.</p>

                    <p>Some time later, they made another announcement. Here is what
                        it said, with the name and release number replaced by pseudonyms:</p>

                    <div class="blockquote">
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We are pleased to announce that
                            following
                            rigorous testing by the Singer Community, Singer&nbsp;5 for Linux
                            and Windows are now ready for production use.</em></span></p></blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>Curious to know what the community had uncovered in "rigorous
                        testing," I went back to the repository to look at its recent change
                        history. The project was still on revision 3. Apparently, they
                        hadn't found a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> bug worth fixing before the
                        release! Thinking that the results of the community testing must have
                        been recorded elsewhere, I next examined the bug tracker. There were
                        exactly six open tickets, four of which had been open for several months
                        already.</p>

                    <p>This beggars belief, of course. When testers pound on a large
                        and complex piece of software for any length of time, they will find
                        bugs. Even if the fixes for those bugs don't make it into the
                        upcoming release, one would still expect some version control activity
                        as a result of the testing process, or at least some new tickets. Yet
                        to all appearances, nothing had happened between the announcement of
                        the open source license and the first open source release.</p>

                    <p>The point is not that the company was lying about the "rigorous
                        testing" by the community (though I suspect they were). The point is
                        that they were oblivious to how much it <span class="emphasis"><em>looked</em></span> like
                        they were lying. Since neither the version control repository nor the
                        ticket tracker gave any indication that the alleged rigorous testing
                        had occurred, the company should either not have made the claim in the
                        first place, or should have provided a clear link to some tangible
                        result of that testing ("We found 278 bugs; click here for details").
                        The latter would have allowed anyone to get a handle on the level of
                        community activity very quickly. As it was, it only took me a few
                        minutes to determine that whatever this community testing was, it had
                        not left traces in any of the usual places. That's not a lot of
                        effort, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who took the trouble.</p>

                    <p>Transparency and verifiability are also an important part of
                        accurate crediting, of course. See

                <p>Refrain from giving negative opinions about competing open
                    source software. It's perfectly okay to give negative
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>facts</em></span>âthat is, easily confirmable
                    assertions of the sort often seen in good comparison charts. But
                    negative characterizations of a less rigorous nature are best avoided,
                    for two reasons. First, they are liable to start flame wars that
                    detract from productive discussion. Second, and more importantly,
                    some of the volunteer developers in <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> project
                    may turn out to work on the competing project as well. This is more
                    likely than it at first might seem: the projects are already in the
                    same domain (that's why they're in competition), and developers with
                    expertise in that domain may make contributions wherever their
                    expertise is applicable. Even when there is no direct developer
                    overlap, it is likely that developers on your project are at least
                    acquainted with developers on related projects. Their ability to
                    maintain constructive personal ties could be hampered by
                    overly negative marketing messages.</p>

                <p>Bashing competing closed-source products seems to be more widely
                    accepted in the open source world, especially when those products are
                    made by Microsoft. Personally, I deplore this tendency (though again,
                    there's nothing wrong with straightforward factual comparisons), not
                    merely because it's rude, but also because it's dangerous for a
                    project to start believing its own hype and thereby ignore the ways in
                    which the competition may actually be superior. In general, watch out
                    for the effect that marketing statements can have on your own
                    development community. People may be so excited at being backed by
                    marketing dollars that they lose objectivity about their software's
                    true strengths and weaknesses. It is normal, and even expected, for a
                    company's developers to exhibit a certain detachment toward marketing
                    statements, even in public forums. Clearly, they should not come out
                    and contradict the marketing message directly (unless it's actually
                    wrong, though one hopes that sort of thing would have been caught
                    earlier). But they may poke fun at it from time to time, as a way of
                    bringing the rest of the development community back down to
                    earth.</p></div>

                companies need to guarantee that certain features and bug fixes land
                in a specified amount of time, they accomplish this by keeping their
                own copy (which may be partially or wholly public) of the project, and
                merging it from time to time with a separate public copy that has its
                own governance. Google's Android operating system is a classic
                example: Google maintains its own copy of Android, which it governs
                pleases, and from time to time merges changes between that copy and

            <p>The ability to write clearly is perhaps the most important skill
                one can have in an open source environment. In the long run it
                matters more than programming talent. A great programmer with lousy
                communications skills can get only one thing done at a time, and even
                then may have trouble convincing others to pay attention. But a lousy
                programmer with good communications skills can coordinate and persuade
                many people to do many different things, and thereby have a
                significant effect on a project's direction and momentum.</p>

            <p>There does not seem to be much correlation, in either direction,
                between the ability to write good code and the ability to communicate
                with one's fellow human beings. There is some correlation between
                programming well and describing technical issues well, but describing
                technical issues is only a tiny part of the communications in a
                project. Much more important is the ability to empathize with one's
                audience, to see one's own posts and comments as others see them, and
                to cause others to see their own posts with similar objectivity.
                Equally important is noticing when a given medium or communications
                method is no longer working well, perhaps because it doesn't scale as
                the number of users increases, and taking the time to do something
                about it.</p>

            <p>All of which is obvious in theoryâwhat makes it hard in
                practice is that free software development environments are
                bewilderingly diverse both in audiences and in communications
                mechanisms. Should a given thought be expressed in a post to the
                mailing list, as an annotation in the bug tracker, or as a comment
                in the code? When answering a question in a public forum, how much
                knowledge can you assume on the part of the reader, given that "the
                reader" is not only the one who asked the question in the first place,
                but all those who might see your response? How can the developers
                stay in constructive contact with the users, without getting swamped
                by feature requests, spurious bug reports, and general chatter? How
                do you tell when a medium has reached the limits of its capacity, and
                what do you do about it?</p>

            <p>Solutions to these problems are usually partial, because any
                particular solution is eventually made obsolete by project growth or
                changes in project structure. They are also often <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
                    hoc</em></span>, because they're improvised responses to dynamic
                situations. All participants need to be aware of when and how
                communications can become bogged down, and be involved in
                solutions. Helping people do this is a big part of managing an open
                source project. The sections that follow discuss both how to conduct
                your own communications, and how to make maintenance of communications
                mechanisms a priority for everyone in the project.<sup>[<a name="idp7797312" href="#ftn.idp7797312"

            <p>Consider this: the only thing anyone knows about you on the
                Internet comes from what you write, or what others write about you.
                You may be brilliant, perceptive, and charismatic in personâbut
                if your emails are rambling and unstructured, people will assume
                that's the real you. Or perhaps you really are rambling and
                unstructured in person, but no one need ever know it, if your posts
                are lucid and informative.</p>

            <p>Devoting some care to your writing will pay off hugely.
                Long-time free software hacker Jim Blandy tells the following
                story:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Back in 1993, I was working for the Free Software Foundation,
                    and we were beta-testing version 19 of GNU Emacs. We'd make a beta
                    release every week or so, and people would try it out and send us
                    bug reports. There was this one guy whom none of us had met in
                    person but who did great work: his bug reports were always clear and
                    led us straight to the problem, and when he provided a fix himself,
                    it was almost always right. He was top-notch.</p>

                    <p>Now, before the FSF can use code written by someone else, we
                        have them do some legal paperwork to assign their copyright interest
                        to that code to the FSF. Just taking code from complete strangers
                        and dropping it in is a recipe for legal disaster.</p>

                    <p>So I emailed the guy the forms, saying, "Here's some paperwork
                        we need, here's what it means, you sign this one, have your employer
                        sign that one, and then we can start putting in your fixes. Thanks
                        very much."</p>

                    <p>He sent me back a message saying, "I don't have an
                        employer."</p>

                    <p>So I said, "Okay, that's fine, just have your university sign
                        it and send it back."</p>

                    <p>After a bit, he wrote me back again, and said, "Well,
                        actually... I'm thirteen years old and I live with my
                        parents."</p></blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>Because that kid didn't write like a thirteen-year-old, no one
                knew that's what he was. Following are some ways to make your writing
                give a good impression too.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Structure and Formatting">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="structure-and-formatting"></a>Structure and Formatting</h3>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Don't fall into the trap of writing everything as though it were
                    a cell phone text message. Write in complete sentences, capitalizing
                    the first word of each sentence, and use paragraph breaks where
                    needed. This is most important in emails and other composed writings.
                    In IRC or similarly ephemeral forums, it's generally okay to leave out
                    capitalization, use compressed forms of common expressions, etc. Just
                    don't carry those habits over into more formal, persistent forums.
                    Emails, documentation, bug reports, and other pieces of writing that
                    are intended to have a permanent life should be written using standard
                    grammar and spelling, and have a coherent narrative structure. This
                    is not because there's anything inherently good about following
                    arbitrary rules, but rather that these rules are
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> arbitrary: they evolved into their present
                    forms because they make text more readable, and you should adhere to
                    them for that reason. Readability is desirable not only because it
                    means more people will understand what you write, but because it makes
                    you look like the sort of person who takes the time to communicate
                    clearly: that is, someone worth paying attention to.</p>

                <p>For email in particular, experienced open source developers have
                    settled on certain conventions:</p>

                <p>Send plain text mails only, not HTML, RichText, or other formats
                    that might get mangled by certain online archives or text-based mail
                    readers. When including screen output, snippets of code, or other
                    preformatted text, offset it clearly, so that even a lazy eye can
                    easily see the boundaries between your prose and the material you're
                    quoting. If the overall structure of your post is still visible from
                    five meters away, you're doing it right. Also, try to keep such
                    preformatted blocks under 72 columns wide, and don't exceed 80
                    columns, which has become the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de
                        facto</em></span>
                    standard terminal width (that is, some people may use wider displays,
                    but no one uses a narrower one). By making your lines a little
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> than 80 columns, you leave room for a few
                    levels of quoting characters to be added in others' replies without
                    forcing a rewrapping of your text.</p>

                <p><a name="quoting-and-top-posting"></a>When quoting someone else's mail,
                    insert your responses where they're most appropriate, at several
                    different places if necessary, and trim off the parts of their mail
                    you didn't use. If you're writing a quick response that applies to
                    their entire post, and your response will be sensible even to someone
                    who hasn't read the original, then it's okay to
                    <em class="firstterm">top-post</em> (that is, to put your response above
                    the quoted text of their mail); otherwise, quote the relevant portion
                    of the original text first, followed by your response.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Construct the subject lines of new mails
                    carefully.</em></span> It's the most important line in your mail,
                    because it allows each other person in the project to decide whether
                    or not to read more. Modern mail reading software organizes groups of
                    related messages into threads, which can be defined not only by a
                    common subject, but by various other headers (which are sometimes not
                    displayed). It follows that if a thread starts to drift to a new
                    topic, you canâand shouldâadjust the subject line
                    accordingly when replying. The thread's integrity will be preserved,
                    due to those other headers, but the new subject will help people
                    looking at an overview of the thread know that the topic has drifted.
                    Likewise, if you really want to start a new topic, do it by posting a
                    fresh mail, not by replying to an existing mail and changing the
                    subject. Otherwise, your mail would still be grouped in to the same
                    thread as what you're replying to, and thus fool people into thinking
                    it's about something it's not. Again, the penalty would not only be
                    the waste of their time, but the slight dent in your credibility as
                    someone fluent in using communications tools.</p></div>

                <p>Well-formatted mails attract readers, but content keeps them.
                    No set of fixed rules can guarantee good content, of course, but there
                    are some principles that make it more likely.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Make things easy for your readers.</em></span>
                    There's a ton of information
                    floating around in any active open source project, and readers cannot
                    be expected to be familiar with most of itâindeed, they cannot
                    always be expected to know how to become familiar. Wherever possible,
                    your posts should provide information in the form most convenient for
                    readers. If you have to spend an extra two minutes to dig up the URL
                    to a particular thread in the mailing list archives, in order to save
                    your readers the trouble of doing so, it's worth it. If you have to
                    spend an extra 5 or 10 minutes summarizing the conclusions so far
                    of a complex thread, in order to give people context in which to
                    understand your post, then do so. Think of it this way: the more
                    successful a project, the higher the reader-to-writer ratio in any
                    given forum. If every post you make is seen by <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>
                    people, then as <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> rises, the worthwhileness of
                    expending extra effort to save those people time rises with it. And
                    as people see you imposing this standard on yourself, they will work
                    to match it in their own communications. The result is, ideally, an
                    increase in the global efficiency of the project: when there is a
                    choice between <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> people making an effort and one
                    person doing so, the project prefers the latter.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Don't engage in hyperbole.</em></span>
                    Exaggerating in online posts is a
                    classic arms race. For example, a person reporting a bug may worry
                    that the developers will not pay sufficient attention, so he'll
                    describe it as a severe, showstopper problem that is preventing him
                    (and all his friends/coworkers/cousins) from using the software
                    productively, when it's actually only a mild annoyance. But
                    exaggeration is not limited to usersâprogrammers often do the
                    same thing during technical debates, particularly when the
                    disagreement is over a matter of taste rather than correctness:</p>

                <p>You will not be able to rid the project of hyperbole completely, and in
                    general it's not necessary to do so. Compared to other forms of
                    miscommunication, hyperbole is not globally damagingâit hurts
                    mainly the perpetrator. The recipients can compensate, it's just that
                    the sender loses a little more credibility each time. Therefore, for
                    the sake of your own influence in the project, try to err on the side
                    of moderation. That way, when you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> need to
                    make a strong point, people will take you seriously.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Edit twice.</em></span>
                    For any message longer than a medium-sized
                    paragraph, reread it from top to bottom before sending it but after
                    you think it's done the first time. This is familiar advice to anyone
                    who's taken a composition class, but it's especially important in
                    online discussion. Because the process of online composition tends to
                    be highly discontinuous (in the course of writing a message, you may
                    need to go back and check other mails, visit certain web pages, run a
                    command to capture its debugging output, etc.), it's especially easy to
                    lose your sense of narrative place. Messages that were composed
                    discontinuously and not checked before being sent are often
                    recognizable as such, much to the chagrin (or so one would hope) of
                    their authors. Take the time to review what you send. The more your
                    posts hold together structurally, the more they will be read by others.</p></div>

                <p>After writing thousands of messages, you will probably find your
                    style tending toward the terse. This seems to be the norm in most
                    technical forums, and there's nothing wrong with it per se. A degree
                    of terseness that would be unacceptable in normal social interactions
                    is simply the default for free software hackers. Here's a response I
                    once drew on a mailing list about some free content management
                    software, quoted in full:</p><pre class="screen">Can you possibly elaborate a bit more on exactly what problems
you ran into, etc?

Also:

What version of Slash are you using? I couldn't tell from your
original message.

Exactly how did you build the apache/mod_perl source?

Did you try the Apache 2.0 patch that was posted about on
slashcode.com?

</pre>
                <p>Now <span class="emphasis"><em>that's</em></span> terse! No greeting, no sign-off
                    other than his name, and the message itself is just a series of
                    questions phrased as compactly as possible. His one declarative
                    sentence was an implicit criticism of my original message. And yet, I
                    was happy to see Shane's mail, and didn't take his terseness as a sign
                    of anything other than him being a busy person. The mere fact that he
                    was asking questions, instead of ignoring my post, meant that he was
                    willing to spend some time on my problem.</p>

                <p>Will all readers react positively to this style? Not
                    necessarily; it depends on the person and the context. For example,
                    if someone has just posted acknowledging that he made a mistake
                    (perhaps he wrote a bug), and you know from past experience that
                    this person tends to be a bit insecure, then while you may still write
                    a compact response, you should make sure to leaven it with some sort
                    of acknowledgment of his feelings. The bulk of your response might
                    be a brief, engineer's-eye analysis of the situation, as terse as you
                    want. But at the end, sign off with something indicating that your
                    terseness is not to be taken as coldness. For example, if you've just
                    given reams of advice about exactly how the person should fix the bug,
                    then sign off with "Good luck, &lt;your name here&gt;" to indicate
                    that you wish him well and are not mad. A strategically placed
                    smiley face or other emoticlue can often be enough to reassure an
                    interlocutor, too.</p>

                <p>It may seem odd to focus as much on the participant's feelings
                    as on the surface of what they say, but, to put it baldly, feelings
                    affect productivity. Feelings are important for other reasons too,
                    but even confining ourselves to purely utilitarian grounds, we may
                    note that unhappy people write worse software and tackle fewer bugs. Given
                    the restricted nature of most electronic media, though, there will
                    often be no overt clue about how a person is feeling. You will have
                    to make an educated guess based on a) how most people would feel in
                    that situation, and b) what you know of this particular person from
                    past interactions. Some people prefer a more hands-off attitude, and
                    simply deal with everyone at face value, the idea being that if a
                    participant doesn't say outright that he feels a particular way, then
                    one has no business treating him as though he does. I don't buy this
                    approach, for a couple of reasons. One, people don't behave that way
                    in real life, so why would they online? Two, since most interactions
                    take place in public forums, people tend to be even more restrained in
                    expressing emotions than they might be in private. To be more
                    precise, they are often willing to express emotions directed at
                    others, such as gratitude or outrage, but not emotions directed
                    inwardly, such as insecurity or pride. Yet most humans work better
                    when they know that others are aware of their state of mind. By
                    paying attention to small clues, you can usually guess right most of
                    the time, and motivate people to stay involved to a greater degree
                    than they otherwise might.</p>

                <p>I don't mean, of course, that your role is to be a group
                    therapist, constantly helping everyone to get in touch with their
                    feelings. But by paying careful attention to long-term patterns in
                    people's behavior, you will begin to get a sense of them as
                    individuals even if you never meet them face-to-face. And by being
                    sensitive to the tone of your own writing, you can have a surprising
                    amount of influence over how others feel, to the ultimate benefit of
                    the project.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Recognizing Rudeness">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>One of the defining characteristics of open source culture is
                    its distinctive notions of what does and does not constitute rudeness.
                    While the conventions described below are not unique to free software
                    development, nor even to software in generalâthey would be
                    familiar to anyone working in mathematics, the hard sciences, or
                    engineering disciplinesâfree software, with its porous
                    boundaries and constant influx of newcomers, is an environment where
                    these conventions are especially likely to be encountered by people
                    unfamiliar with them.</p>

                <p>Let's start with the things that are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
                    rude:</p>

                <p>Technical criticism, even when direct and unpadded, is not rude.
                    Indeed, it can be a form of flattery: the critic is saying, by
                    implication, that the target is worth taking seriously, and is worth
                    spending some time on. That is, the more viable it would have been to
                    simply ignore someone's post, the more of a compliment it becomes to
                    take the time to criticize it (unless the critique descends into an
                    <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad hominem</em></span> attack or some other
                    form of
                    obvious rudeness, of course).</p>

                <p>Blunt, unadorned questions, such as Shane's questions to me in
                    the previously quoted email, are not rude either. Questions that in
                    other contexts might seem cold, rhetorical, or even mocking, are often
                    intended seriously, and have no hidden agenda other than eliciting
                    information as quickly as possible. The famous technical support
                    question "Is your computer plugged in?" is a classic example of this.
                    The support person really does need to know if your computer is
                    plugged in, and after the first few days on the job, has gotten tired
                    of prefixing her question with polite blandishments ("I beg your
                    pardon, I just want to ask a few simple questions to rule out some
                    possibilities. Some of these might seem pretty basic, but bear with
                    me..."). At this point, she doesn't bother with the padding anymore,
                    she just asks straight out: is it plugged in or not? Equivalent
                    questions are asked all the time on free software mailing lists. The
                    intent is not to insult the recipient, but to quickly rule out the
                    most obvious (and perhaps most common) explanations. Recipients who
                    understand this and react accordingly win points for taking a
                    broad-minded view without prompting. But recipients who react badly
                    must not be reprimanded, either. It's just a collision of cultures,
                    not anyone's fault. Explain amiably that your question (or criticism)
                    had no hidden meanings; it was just meant to get (or transmit)
                    information as efficiently as possible, nothing more.</p>

                <p>So what <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> rude?</p>

                <p>By the same principle under which detailed technical criticism
                    is a form of flattery, failure to provide quality criticism can be a
                    kind of insult. I don't mean simply ignoring someone's work, be it a
                    proposal, code change, new ticket filing, or whatever. Unless you
                    explicitly promised a detailed reaction in advance, it's usually okay
                    to simply not react at all. People will assume you just didn't have
                    time to say anything. But if you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> react, don't
                    skimp: take the time to really analyze things, provide concrete
                    examples where appropriate, dig around in the archives to find related
                    posts from the past, etc. Or if you don't have time to put in that
                    kind of effort, but still need to write some sort of brief response,
                    then state the shortcoming openly in your message ("I think there's a
                    ticket filed for this, but unfortunately didn't have time to search for
                    it, sorry"). The main thing is to recognize the existence of the
                    cultural norm, either by fulfilling it or by openly acknowledging
                    that one has fallen short this time. Either way, the norm is
                    strengthened. But failing to meet that norm, while at the same time
                    not explaining <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you failed to meet it, is like
                    saying the topic (and those participating in it) was not worth much
                    of your timeâthat your time is more valuable than theirs.
                    Better to show that your time is valuable by being terse than by being
                    lazy.</p>

                <p>There are many other forms of rudeness, of course, but most of
                    them are not specific to free software development, and common sense
                    is a good enough guide to avoid them. See also

                <p>There is a region in the human brain devoted specifically to
                    recognizing faces. It is known informally as the "fusiform face
                    area" and apparently its capabilities are at least partly inborn, not
                    learned. It turns out that recognizing individual people is such a
                    crucial survival skill that we have evolved specialized hardware to do
                    it.</p>

                <p>Internet-based collaboration is therefore psychologically odd,
                    because it involves tight cooperation between human beings who almost
                    never get to identify each other by the most natural, intuitive
                    methods: facial recognition first of all, but also sound of voice,
                    posture, etc. To compensate for this, try to use a consistent
                    <em class="firstterm">screen name</em> everywhere. It should be the front
                    part of your email address (the part before the @-sign), your IRC
                    username, your repository committer name, your ticket tracker username,
                    and so on. This name is your online "face": a short identifying
                    string that serves some of the same purpose as your real face,
                    although it does not, unfortunately, stimulate the same built-in
                    hardware in the brain.</p>

                <p>The screen name should be some intuitive permutation of your
                    real name (mine, for example, is "kfogel"). In some situations it
                    will be accompanied by your full name anyway, for example in mail
                    headers:</p><pre class="screen">From: "Karl Fogel" &lt;kfogel@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre>
                <p>Actually, there are two things going on in that example. As
                    mentioned earlier, the screen name matches the real name in an
                    intuitive way. But also, the real name is <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span>.
                    That is, it's not some made-up appellation like:</p><pre class="screen">From: "Wonder Hacker" &lt;wonderhacker@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre>
                <p>There's a famous cartoon by Paul Steiner, from the July 5, 1993
                    issue of <em class="citetitle">The New Yorker</em>, that shows one dog
                    logged into a computer terminal, looking down and telling another
                    conspiratorially: "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog." This
                    kind of thought probably lies behind a lot of the self-aggrandizing,
                    meant-to-be-hip online identities people give themselvesâas if
                    calling oneself "Wonder Hacker" will actually cause people to believe
                    one <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a wonderful hacker. But the fact remains:
                    even if no one knows you're a dog, you're still a dog. A fantastical
                    online identity never impresses readers. Instead, it makes them think
                    you're more into image than substance, or that you're simply insecure.
                    Use your real name for all interactions, or if for some reason you
                    require anonymity, then make up a name that sounds like a perfectly
                    normal real name, and use it consistently.</p>

                <p>In addition to keeping your online face consistent, there are
                    some things you can do to make it more attractive. If you have an
                    official title (e.g., "doctor", "professor", "director"), don't flaunt
                    it, nor even mention it except when it's directly relevant to the
                    conversation. Hackerdom in general, and free software culture in
                    particular, tends to view title displays as exclusionary and a sign of
                    insecurity. It's okay if your title appears as part of a standard
                    signature block at the end of every mail you send, just don't ever use
                    it as a tool to bolster your position in a discussionâthe
                    attempt is guaranteed to backfire. You want folks to respect the
                    person, not the title.</p>

                <p>Speaking of signature blocks: keep them small and tasteful, or
                    better yet, nonexistent. Avoid large legal disclaimers tacked on to
                    the end of every mail, especially when they express sentiments
                    incompatible with participation in a free software project. For
                    example, the following classic of the genre appears at the end of
                    every post a particular user makes to a certain project mailing list:</p><pre class="screen">IMPORTANT NOTICE

                <p>For someone who's just showing up to ask a question now and
                    then, that huge disclaimer looks a bit silly but probably doesn't do
                    any lasting harm. However, if this person wanted to participate
                    actively in the project, that legal boilerplate would start to have a
                    more insidious effect. It would send at least two potentially
                    destructive signals: first, that this person doesn't have full control
                    over his toolsâhe's trapped inside some corporate mailer that
                    tacks an annoying message to the end of every email, and he hasn't got
                    any way to route around itâand second, that he has little or no
                    organizational support for his free software activities. True, the
                    organization has clearly not banned him outright from posting to
                    public lists, but it has made his posts look distinctly unwelcoming,
                    as though the risk of letting out confidential information must trump
                    all other priorities.</p>

                <p>If you work for an organization that insists on adding such
                    signature blocks to all outgoing mail, and you can't get the policy
                    changed, then consider using your personal email account to post, even
                    if you're being paid by your employer for your participation in the
                    project.</p></div>

                <p>A common pitfall in online project participation is to think
                    that you have to respond to everything. You don't. First of all,
                    there will usually be more threads going on than you can keep track
                    of, at least after the project really gets going. Second,
                    even in the threads that you have decided to engage in, much of what
                    people say will not require a response. Development forums in
                    particular tend to be dominated by three kinds of messages:</p>

                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Messages proposing something non-trivial</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Messages expressing support or opposition to
                            something someone else has said</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Summing-up messages</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>None of these <span class="emphasis"><em>inherently</em></span> requires a
                    response, particularly if you can be fairly sure, based on watching
                    the thread so far, that someone else is likely to say what you would
                    have said anyway. (If you're worried that you'll be caught in a
                    wait-wait loop because all the others are using this tactic too, don't
                    be; there's almost always <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> out there
                    who'll feel like jumping into the fray.) A response should be
                    motivated by a definite purpose. Ask yourself first: do you know what
                    you want to accomplish? And second: will it not get accomplished
                    unless you say something?</p>

                <p>Two good reasons to add your voice to a thread are a) when you
                    see a flaw in a proposal and suspect that you're the only one who sees
                    it, and b) when you see that miscommunication is happening between
                    others, and know that you can fix it with a clarifying post. It's
                    also generally fine to post just to thank someone for doing something,
                    or to say "Me too!", because a reader can tell right away that such
                    posts do not require any response or further action, and therefore the
                    mental effort demanded by the post ends cleanly when the reader
                    reaches the last line of the mail. But even then, think twice before
                    saying something; it's always better to leave people wishing you'd
                    post more than wishing you'd post less. (The second half of

                    about how to behave
                    on a busy mailing list.)</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Productive vs Unproductive Threads">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>On a busy mailing list, you have two imperatives. One,
                    obviously, is to figure out what you need to pay attention to and what
                    you can ignore. The other is to behave in a way that
                    avoids <span class="emphasis"><em>causing</em></span> noise: not only do you want your
                    own posts to have a high signal/noise ratio, you also want them to be
                    the sorts of messages that stimulate <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> people
                    to either post with a similarly high signal/noise ratio, or not post
                    at all.</p>

                <p>To see how to do that, let's consider the context in which it is
                    done. What are some of the hallmarks of an unproductive thread?</p>

                <div class="itemizedlist">
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Arguments that have been made already start to be
                            repeated in the same thread, as though the poster thinks
                            no one heard them the first time.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Increasing levels of hyperbole and involvement as
                            the stakes get smaller and smaller.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>A majority of comments coming from people who do
                            little or nothing, while the people who tend to get things
                            done are silent.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Many ideas discussed without clear proposals ever
                            being made. (Of course, any interesting idea starts out
                            as an imprecise vision; the important question is what
                            direction it goes from there. Does the thread seem to be
                            turning the vision into something more concrete, or is it
                            spinning off into sub-visions, side-visions, and
                            ontological disputes?)</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Just because a thread is not productive at first doesn't mean
                    it's a waste of time. It might be about an important topic, in which
                    case the fact that it's not making any headway is all the more
                    troublesome.</p>

                <p>Guiding a thread toward usefulness without being pushy is an
                    art. It won't work to simply admonish people to stop wasting their
                    time, or to ask them not to post unless they have something constructive
                    to say. You may, of course, think these things privately, but if you
                    say them out loud then you will be offensiveâand
                    ineffective. Instead, you have to
                    suggest conditions for further progress: give people a route, a
                    path to follow that leads to the results you want, yet without
                    sounding like you're dictating conduct. The distinction is largely
                    one of tone. For example, this is bad:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This discussion is going nowhere. Can
                        we please
                        drop this topic until someone has a patch to implement one of
                        these proposals? There's no reason to keep going around and
                        around saying the same things. Code speaks louder than
                        words, folks.</em></span></p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>Whereas this is good:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Several proposals have been floated in
                        this
                        thread, but none have had all the details fleshed out, at least
                        not enough for an up-or-down vote. Yet we're also not saying
                        anything new now; we're just reiterating what has been said
                        before. So the best thing at this point would probably be for
                        further posts to contain either a complete specification for the
                        proposed behavior, or a patch. Then at least we'd have a
                        definite action to take (i.e., get consensus on the
                        specification, or apply and test the patch).</em></span></p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>Contrast the second approach with the first. The second way
                    does not draw a line between you and the others, or accuse them of
                    taking the discussion into a spiral. It talks about "we", which is
                    important whether or not you actually participated in the thread
                    before now, because it reminds everyone that even those who have been
                    silent thus far still have a stake in the thread's outcome. It
                    describes why the thread is going nowhere, but does so without
                    pejoratives or judgementsâit just dispassionately states
                    some facts. Most importantly, it offers a positive course of action,
                    so that instead of people feeling like discussion is being closed off
                    (a restriction against which they can only be tempted to rebel), they
                    will feel as if they're being offered a way to take the conversation
                    to a more constructive level, if they're willing to make the effort.
                    This is a standard the most productive people will naturally want to
                    meet.</p>

                <p>You won't always want a thread to make it to the next level of
                    constructivenessâsometimes you'll want it to just go away. The
                    purpose of your post, then, is to make it do one or the other. If you
                    can tell from the way the thread has gone so far that no one is
                    actually <span class="emphasis"><em>going</em></span> to take the steps you suggested,
                    then your post effectively shuts down the thread without seeming to do
                    so. Of course, there isn't any foolproof way to shut down a thread,
                    and even if there were, you wouldn't want to use it. But asking
                    participants to either make visible progress or stop posting is
                    perfectly defensible, if done diplomatically. Be wary of quashing
                    threads prematurely, however. Some amount of speculative chatter can
                    be productive, depending on the topic, and asking for it to be
                    resolved too quickly will stifle the creative process, as well as make
                    you look impatient.</p>

                <p>Don't expect any thread to stop on a dime. There will probably
                    still be a few posts after yours, either because mails got crossed in
                    the pipe, or because people want to have the last word. This is
                    nothing to worry about, and you don't need to post again. Just let
                    the thread peter out, or not peter out, as the case may be. You can't
                    have complete control; on the other hand, you can expect to have a
                    statistically significant effect across many threads.</p></div>

                <p>Although discussion can meander in any topic, the probability of
                    meandering goes up as the technical difficulty of the topic goes down.
                    After all, the greater the technical complexity, the fewer
                    participants can really follow what's going on. Those who can are
                    likely to be the most experienced developers, who have already taken
                    part in such discussions many times before, and know what sort
                    of behavior is likely to lead to a consensus everyone can live
                    with.</p>

                <p>Thus, consensus is hardest to achieve in technical questions
                    that are simple to understand and easy to have an opinion about, and
                    in "soft" topics such as organization, publicity, funding, etc.
                    People can participate in those arguments forever, because there are
                    no qualifications necessary for doing so, no clear ways to decide (even
                    afterward) if a decision was right or wrong, and because simply
                    outwaiting other discussants is sometimes a successful tactic.</p>

                <p>The principle that the amount of discussion is inversely
                    proportional to the complexity of the topic has been around for a long
                    time, and is known informally as the <em class="firstterm">Bikeshed

                    from a now-famous post made to BSD developers:</p>

                        into the dynamics of management.</p>

                        <p>[...]</p>

                        <p>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the other vital
                            component is an atomic power-plant, I guess that illustrates the age
                            of the book.</p>

                        <p>Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and
                            get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar
                            atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be
                            tangled up in endless discussions.</p>

                        <p>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so
                            vast, so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, and
                            rather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody else
                            checked all the details before it got this far. Richard P. Feynmann
                            gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point, examples
                            relating to Los Alamos in his books.</p>

                        <p>A bike shed on the other hand. Anyone can build one of those
                            over a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV. So no
                            matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with your
                            proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his
                            job, that he is paying attention, that he
                            is <span class="emphasis"><em>here</em></span>.</p>

                        <p>In Denmark we call it "setting your fingerprint". It is about
                            personal pride and prestige, it is about being able to point somewhere
                            and say "There! <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> did that." It is a strong
                            trait in politicians, but present in most people given the chance.
                            Just think about footsteps in wet cement.</p></blockquote>

                <p>(Kamp's complete post is very much worth reading, too; see
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://bikeshed.com/" target="_top">bikeshed.com</a>.)</p>

                <p>Anyone who's ever taken regular part in group decision-making
                    will recognize what Kamp is talking about. However, it is usually
                    impossible to persuade <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> to avoid painting
                    bikesheds. The best you can do is point out that the phenomenon
                    exists, when you see it happening, and persuade the senior
                    developersâthe people whose posts carry the most weightâto
                    drop their paintbrushes early, so at least they're not contributing to
                    the noise. Bikeshed painting parties will never go away entirely, but
                    you can make them shorter and less frequent by spreading an awareness
                    of the phenomenon in the project's culture.</p></div>

                <p>A <em class="firstterm">holy war</em> is a dispute, often but not
                    always over a relatively minor issue, which is not resolvable on the
                    merits of the arguments, but where people feel passionate enough to
                    continue arguing anyway in the hope that their side will prevail.
                    Holy wars are not quite the same as bikeshed painting. People
                    painting bikesheds may be quick to jump in with an opinion, but they
                    won't necessarily feel strongly about it,
                    and indeed will sometimes express other, incompatible opinions, to
                    show that they understand all sides of the issue. In a holy war, on
                    the other hand, understanding the other sides is a sign of weakness.
                    In a holy war, everyone knows there is One Right Answer; they just
                    don't agree on what it is.</p>

                <p>Once a holy war has started, it generally cannot be resolved to
                    everyone's satisfaction. It does no good to point out, in the midst
                    of a holy war, that a holy war is going on. Everyone knows that
                    already. Unfortunately, a common feature of holy wars is disagreement
                    on the very question of <span class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> the dispute is
                    resolvable by continued discussion. Viewed from outside, it is clear
                    that neither side is changing the other's mind. Viewed from inside,
                    the other side is being obtuse and not thinking clearly, but they
                    might come around if browbeaten enough. Now, I am
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> saying there's never a right side in a holy
                    war. Sometimes there isâin the holy wars I've participated
                    in, it's always been my side, of course. But it doesn't matter,
                    because there's no algorithm for convincingly demonstrating that one
                    side or the other is right.</p>

                <p>A common, but unsatisfactory, way people try to resolve holy
                    wars is to say "We've already spent far more time and energy
                    discussing this than it's worth! Can we please just drop it?" There
                    are two problems with this. First, that time and energy has already
                    been spent and can never be recoveredâthe only question now is,
                    how much <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> effort remains? If some people
                    feel that just a little more discussion will resolve the issue in
                    their favor, then it still makes sense (from their point of view) to
                    continue.</p>

                <p>The other problem with asking for the matter to be dropped is
                    that this is often equivalent to allowing one side, the status quo, to
                    declare victory by inaction. And in some cases, the status quo is
                    known to be unacceptable anyway: everyone agrees that some decision
                    must be made, some action taken. Dropping the subject would be worse
                    for everyone than simply giving up the argument would be for anyone.
                    But since that dilemma applies to all equally, it's still possible to
                    end up arguing forever about what to do.</p>

                <p>So how should you handle holy wars?</p>

                <p>The first answer is, try to set things up so they don't happen.
                    This is not as hopeless as it sounds:</p>

                <p>You can anticipate certain standard holy wars: they tend to come
                    up over programming languages, licenses (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#license-compatibility" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">the section
                        called âThe GPL and License Compatibilityâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
      title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10, <i>Legal
                        Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a></span>), reply-to munging (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#reply-to" title="The Great Reply-to Debate">the section called âThe Great
                        Reply-to Debateâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>), and a few
                    other topics. Each project
                    usually has a holy war or two all its own, as well, which longtime
                    developers will quickly become familiar with. The techniques for
                    stopping holy wars, or at least limiting their damage, are pretty much
                    the same everywhere. Even if you are positive your side is right, try
                    to find <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> way to express sympathy and
                    understanding for the points the other side is making. Often the
                    problem in a holy war is that because each side has built its walls
                    as high as possible and made it clear that any other opinion is sheer
                    foolishness, the act of surrendering or changing one's mind becomes
                    psychologically unbearable: it would be an admission not just of being
                    wrong, but of having been <span class="emphasis"><em>certain</em></span> and still being
                    wrong. The way you can make this admission palatable for the other
                    side is to express some uncertainty yourselfâprecisely by
                    showing that you understand the arguments they are making and find
                    them at least sensible, if not finally persuasive. Make a gesture
                    that provides space for a reciprocal gesture, and usually the
                    situation will improve. You are no more or less likely to get the
                    technical result you wanted, but at least you can avoid unnecessary
                    collateral damage to the project's morale.</p>

                <p>When a holy war can't be avoided, decide early how much you
                    care, and then be willing to publicly give up. When you do so, you
                    can say that you're backing out because the holy war isn't worth it,
                    but don't express any bitterness and <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> take
                    the opportunity for a last parting shot at the opposing side's
                    arguments. Giving up is effective only when done gracefully.</p>

                <p>Programming language holy wars are a bit of a special case,
                    because they are often highly technical, yet many people feel
                    qualified to take part in them, and the stakes are very high, since
                    the result may determine what language a good portion of the project's
                    code is written in. The best solution is to choose the language
                    early, with buy-in from influential initial developers, and then
                    defend it on the grounds that it's what you are all comfortable
                    writing in, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> on the grounds that it's better
                    than some other language that could have been used instead. Never let
                    the conversation degenerate into an academic comparison of programming
                    languages (this seems to happen especially often when someone brings
                    up Perl, for some reason); that's a death topic that you must simply
                    refuse to be drawn into.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In any mailing list discussion, it's easy for a small minority
                    to give the impression that there is a great deal of dissent, by
                    flooding the list with numerous lengthy emails. It's a bit like a
                    filibuster, except that the illusion of widespread dissent is even
                    more powerful, because it's divided across an arbitrary number of
                    discrete posts and most people won't bother to keep track of who said
                    what, when. They'll just have an instinctive impression that the topic
                    is very controversial, and wait for the fuss to die down.</p>

                <p>The best way to counteract this effect is to point it out very
                    clearly and provide supporting evidence showing how small the actual
                    number of dissenters is, compared to those in agreement. In order to
                    increase the disparity, you may want to privately poll people who have
                    been mostly silent, but who you suspect would agree with the majority.
                    Don't say anything that suggests the dissenters were deliberately
                    trying to inflate the impression they were making. Chances are they
                    weren't, and even if they were, there would be no strategic advantage
                    to pointing it out. All you need do is show the actual numbers in a
                    side-by-side comparison, and people will realize that their intuition
                    of the situation does not match reality.</p>

                <p>This advice doesn't just apply to issues with clear
                    for-and-against positions. It applies to any discussion where a fuss
                    is being made but it's not clear that most people consider the issue
                    under discussion to be a real problem. After a while, if you agree that
                    the issue is not worthy of action, and can see that it has failed to
                    get much traction (even if it has generated a lot of mails), you can
                    just observe publicly that it's not getting traction. If the "Noisy
                    Minority" effect has been at work, your post will seem like a breath of
                    fresh air. Most people's impression of the discussion up to that
                    point will have been somewhat murky: "Huh, it sure feels like there's
                    some big deal here, because there sure are a lot of posts, but I can't
                    see any clear progress happening." By explaining how the form of the
                    discussion made it appear more turbulent than it really was, you
                    retrospectively give it a new shape, through which people can recast
                    their understanding of what transpired.</p></div>

            <p>Difficult people are no easier to deal with in electronic forums
                than they are in person. By "difficult" I don't mean "rude". Rude
                people are annoying, but they're not necessarily difficult. This book
                has already discussed how to handle them: comment on the rudeness the
                first time, and from then on, either ignore them or treat them the same
                as anyone else. If they continue being rude, they will usually make
                themselves so unpopular as to have no influence on others in the
                project, so they are a self-containing problem.</p>

            <p>The really difficult cases are people who are not overtly rude,
                but who manipulate or abuse the project's processes in a way that ends
                up costing other people time and energy, yet do not bring any benefit
                to the project<sup>[<a name="idp7945152" href="#ftn.idp7945152" class="footnote">47</a>]</sup>.</p>

            <p>Often, such people look for wedgepoints in the project's
                procedures, to give themselves more influence than they might
                otherwise have. This is much more insidious than mere rudeness,
                because neither the behavior nor the damage it causes is apparent to
                casual observers. A classic example is the filibuster, in which
                someone (always sounding as reasonable as possible, of course) keeps
                claiming that the matter under discussion is not ready for resolution,
                and offers more and more possible solutions, or new viewpoints on old
                solutions, when what is really going on is that he senses that a
                consensus or a ballot is about to form and he doesn't like where it's
                headed. Another example is when there's a debate that won't converge
                on consensus, but the group tries to at least clarify the points of
                disagreement and produce a summary for everyone to refer to from then
                on. The obstructionist, who knows the summary may lead to a result he
                doesn't like, will often try to delay even the summary, by
                relentlessly complicating the question of what should be in it, either
                by objecting to reasonable suggestions or by introducing unexpected
                new items.</p>

                <p>To counteract such behavior, it helps to understand the
                    mentality of those who engage in it. People generally do not do it
                    consciously. No one wakes up in the morning and says to himself:
                    "Today I'm going to cynically manipulate procedural forms in order to
                    be an irritating obstructionist." Instead, such actions are often
                    preceded by a semi-paranoid feeling of being shut out of group
                    interactions and decisions. The person feels he is not being taken
                    seriously, or (in the more severe cases) that there is almost a
                    conspiracy against himâthat the other project members have decided to
                    form an exclusive club, of which he is not a member. This then
                    justifies, in his mind, taking rules literally and engaging in a
                    formal manipulation of the project's procedures, in order
                    to <span class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span> everyone else take him seriously. In
                    extreme cases, the person can even believe that he is fighting a
                    lonely battle to save the project from itself.</p>

                <p>It is the nature of such an attack from within that not everyone
                    will notice it at the same time, and some people may not see it at all
                    unless presented with very strong evidence. This means that
                    neutralizing it can be quite a bit of work. It's not enough to
                    persuade yourself that it's happening; you have to marshal enough
                    evidence to persuade others too, and then you have to distribute that
                    evidence in a thoughtful way.</p>

                <p>Given that it's so much work to fight, it's often better just to
                    tolerate it for a while. Think of it like a parasitic but mild
                    disease: if it's not too debilitating, the project can afford to
                    remain infected, and medicine might have harmful side effects.
                    However, if it gets too damaging to tolerate, then it's time for
                    action. Start gathering notes on the patterns you see. Make sure to
                    include references to public archivesâthis is one of the reasons
                    the project keeps records, so you might as well use them. Once you've
                    got a good case built, start having private conversations with other
                    project participants. Don't tell them what you've observed; instead,
                    first ask them what they've observed. This may be your last chance to
                    get unfiltered feedback about how others see the troublemaker's
                    behavior; once you start openly talking about it, opinion will
                    become polarized and no one will be able to remember what he
                    formerly thought about the matter.</p>

                <p>If private discussions indicate that at least some others see
                    the problem too, then it's time to do something. That's when you
                    have to get <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> cautious, because it's very
                    easy for this sort of person to try to make it appear as though you're
                    picking on them unfairly. Whatever you do, never accuse them of
                    maliciously abusing the project's procedures, of being paranoid, or, in
                    general, of any of the other things that you suspect are probably
                    true. Your strategy should be to look both more reasonable and more
                    concerned with the overall welfare of the project, with the goal of
                    either reforming the person's behavior, or getting them to go away
                    permanently. Depending on the other developers, and your relationship
                    with them, it may be advantageous to gather allies privately first.
                    Or it may not; that might just create ill will behind the scenes, if
                    people think you're engaging in an improper whispering
                    campaign.</p>

                <p>Remember that although the other person may be the one behaving
                    destructively, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> will be the one who appears
                    destructive if you make a public charge that you can't back up. Be
                    sure to have plenty of examples to demonstrate what you're saying, and
                    say it as gently as possible while still being direct. You may not
                    persuade the person in question, but that's okay as long as you
                    persuade everyone else.</p></div>

                <p>I remember only a few situations, in more than 20 years of working
                    in free software, where things got so bad that we actually had to ask
                    someone to stop posting altogether. In the example I'll use here, the
                    person was not rude, and sincerely wanted only to be helpful. He just
                    didn't know when to post and when not to post. Our lists were open to the
                    public, and he was posting so often, and asking questions on so many
                    different topics, that it was getting to be a noise problem for the
                    community. We'd already tried asking him nicely to do a little more
                    research for answers before posting, but that had no effect.</p>

                <p>The strategy that finally worked is a perfect example of how to
                    build a strong case on neutral, quantitative data. One of our
                    developers, Brian Fitzpatrick, did some digging in the archives, and
                    then sent the
                    following message privately to a few developers. The offender (the
                    third name on the list below, shown here as "J. Random") had very
                    little history with the project, and had contributed no code or
                    documentation. Yet he was the third most active poster on the mailing
                    lists:</p><pre class="screen">From: "Brian W. Fitzpatrick" &lt;fitz@collab.net&gt;

Subject: The Subversion Energy Sink
Date: Wed, 12 Nov 2003 23:37:47 -0600

In the last 25 days, the top 6 posters to the svn [dev|users] list have
been:

    294  kfogel@collab.net
    236  "C. Michael Pilato" &lt;cmpilato@collab.net&gt;
    220  "J. Random" &lt;jrandom@problematic-poster.com&gt;
    176  Branko Äibej &lt;brane@xbc.nu&gt;
    130  Philip Martin &lt;philip@codematters.co.uk&gt;
    126  Ben Collins-Sussman &lt;sussman@collab.net&gt;

I would say that five of these people are contributing to Subversion
hitting 1.0 in the near future.

I would also say that one of these people is consistently drawing time
and energy from the other 5, not to mention the list as a whole, thus
(albeit unintentionally) slowing the development of Subversion.  I did
not do a threaded analysis, but vgrepping my Subversion mail spool tells
me that every mail from this person is responded to at least once by at
least 2 of the other 5 people on the above list.

I think some sort of radical intervention is necessary here, even if we
do scare the aforementioned person away.  Niceties and kindness have
already proven to have no effect.

dev@subversion is a mailing list to facilitate development of a version
control system, not a group therapy session.

-Fitz, attempting to wade through three days of svn mail that he let
 pile up
</pre>
                <p>Though it might not seem so at first, J. Random's behavior was a
                    classic case of abusing project procedures. He wasn't doing something
                    obvious like trying to filibuster a vote, but he was taking advantage
                    of the mailing list's policy of relying on self-moderation by its
                    members. We left it to each individual's judgement when to post and
                    on what topics. Thus, we had no procedural recourse for dealing with
                    someone who either did not have, or would not exercise, such judgement.
                    There was no rule one could point to and say the fellow was violating
                    it, yet everyone except him knew that his frequent posting was getting
                    to be a serious problem.</p>

                <p>Fitz's strategy was, in retrospect, masterful. He gathered
                    damning quantitative evidence, but then distributed it discreetly,
                    sending it first to a few people whose support would be key in any
                    drastic action. They agreed that some sort of action was necessary,
                    and in the end we called J. Random on the phone, described the problem
                    to him directly, and asked him to simply stop posting. He never
                    really did understand the reasons why; if he had been capable
                    of understanding, he probably would have exercised appropriate
                    judgement in the first place. But he agreed to stop posting, and the
                    mailing lists became useable again. Part of the reason this strategy
                    worked was, perhaps, the implicit threat that we could start
                    restricting his posts via the moderation software normally used for
                    preventing spam (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#spam-prevention" title="Spam Prevention">the section called âSpam
                        Preventionâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>). But the
                    reason we were able to have that option in reserve was that Fitz had
                    gathered the necessary support from key people first.</p></div>

            <p>The price of success is heavy in the open source world. As your
                software gets more popular, the number of people who show up looking
                for information increases dramatically, while the number of people
                able to provide information increases much more slowly. Furthermore,
                even if the ratio were evenly balanced, there is still a fundamental
                scalability problem with the way most open source projects handle
                communications. Consider mailing lists, for example. Most projects
                have a mailing list for general user questionsâsometimes the
                list's name is "users", "discuss", "help", or something else.
                Whatever its name, the purpose of the list is always the same: to
                provide a place where people can get their questions answered, while
                others watch and (presumably) absorb knowledge from observing these
                exchanges.</p>

            <p>These mailing lists work very well up to a few thousand users
                and/or a couple of hundred posts a day. But somewhere after that, the
                system starts to break down, because every subscriber sees every post;
                if the number of posts to the list begins to exceed what any
                individual reader can process in a day, the list becomes a burden to
                its members. Imagine, for instance, if Microsoft had such a mailing
                list for Windows. Windows has hundreds of millions of users; if
                even one-tenth of one percent of them had questions in a given
                twenty-four hour period, then this hypothetical list would get
                hundreds of thousands of posts per day! Such a list could never
                exist, of course, because no one would stay subscribed to it.
                This problem is not limited to mailing lists; the same logic applies
                to IRC channels, other discussion forums, indeed to any system in
                which a group hears questions from individuals. The implications are
                ominous: the usual open source model of massively parallelized support
                simply does not scale to the levels needed for world
                domination.<sup>[<a name="idp7967472" href="#ftn.idp7967472" class="footnote">48</a>]</sup></p>

            <p>There will be no explosion when forums reach the breaking point.
                There is just a quiet negative feedback effect: people unsubscribe
                from the lists, or leave the IRC channel, or at any rate stop
                bothering to ask questions, because they can see they won't be heard
                in all the noise. As more and more people make this highly rational
                choice, the forum's activity will seem to stay at a manageable level.
                But it is staying manageable precisely because the rational (or at
                least, experienced) people have started looking elsewhere for
                informationâwhile the inexperienced people stay behind and
                continue posting. In other words, one side effect of continuing to
                use unscalable communications models as a project grows is that the
                average <span class="emphasis"><em>quality</em></span> of communications tends to go
                down. As the benefit/cost ratio of using high-population forums
                goes down, naturally those with the experience to do so start to look
                elsewhere for answers first. Adjusting communications mechanisms to
                cope with project growth therefore involves two related strategies:</p>

            <div class="orderedlist">
                <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Recognizing when particular parts of a forum are
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> suffering unbounded growth, even
                        if the forum as a whole is, and separating those parts
                        off into new, more specialized forums (i.e., don't let
                        the good be dragged down by the bad).</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Making sure there are many automated sources
                        of information available, and that they are kept
                        organized, up-to-date, and easy to find.</p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Strategy (1) is usually not too hard. Most projects start out
                with one main forum: a general discussion mailing list, on which
                feature ideas, design questions, and coding problems can all be hashed
                out. Everyone involved with the project is on the list. After a
                while, it usually becomes clear that the list has evolved into several
                distinct topic-based sublists. For example, some threads are clearly
                about development and design; others are user questions of the "How do
                I do X?" variety; maybe there's a third topic family centered around
                processing bug reports and enhancement requests; and so on. A given
                individual, of course, might participate in many different thread
                types, but the important thing is that there is not a lot of overlap
                between the types themselves. They could be divided into separate
                lists without causing harmful balkanization, because the threads
                rarely cross topic boundaries.</p>

            <p>Actually doing this division is a two-step process. You create
                the new list (or IRC channel, or whatever it is to be), and then you
                spend whatever time is necessary gently nagging and reminding people
                to <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the new forums appropriately. That latter
                step can last for weeks, but eventually people will get the idea. You
                simply have to make a point of always telling the sender when a post
                is sent to the wrong destination, and do so visibly, so that other
                people are encouraged to help out with routing. It's also useful to
                have a web page providing a guide to all the lists available; your
                responses can simply reference that web page and, as a bonus, the
                recipient may learn something about looking for guidelines before
                posting.</p>

            <p>Strategy (2) is an ongoing process, lasting the lifetime of the
                project and involving many participants. Of course it is partly a
                matter of having up-to-date documentation (see
                <a class="xref" href="#documentation" title="Documentation">the section called âDocumentationâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>) and making sure to
                point people there. But it is also much more than that; the sections
                that follow discuss this strategy in detail.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-archives"></a>Conspicuous Use of Archives</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Typically, all communications in an open source project, except
                    sometimes IRC conversations, are archived. The archives are public
                    and searchable, and have referential stability: that is, once a given
                    piece of information is recorded at a particular address (URL), it
                    stays at that address forever.</p>

                <p>Use those archives as much as possible, and as conspicuously as
                    possible. Even when you know the answer to some question off the top
                    of your head, if you think there's a reference in the archives that
                    contains the answer, spend the time to dig it up and present it.
                    Every time you do that in a publicly visible way, some people learn
                    for the first time that the archives are there, and that searching in
                    them can produce answers. Also, by referring to the archives instead
                    of rewriting the advice, you reinforce the social norm against
                    duplicating information. Why have the same answer in two different
                    places? When the number of places it can be found is kept to a
                    minimum, people who have found it before are more likely to remember
                    what to search for to find it again. Well-placed references also
                    contribute to the quality of search results in general, because they
                    strengthen the targeted resource's ranking in Internet search
                    engines.</p>

                <p>There are times when duplicating information makes sense,
                    however. For example, suppose there's a response already in the
                    archives, not from you, saying:</p><pre class="screen">It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  To
unfrobnicate them, run these steps:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Run the 'defrobnicate' program that ships with Scanley.
3. Start up the server.
</pre>
                <p>Then, months later, you see another post indicating that
                    someone's indexes have become frobnicated. You search the archives
                    and come up with the old response above, but you realize it's missing
                    some steps (perhaps by mistake, or perhaps because the software has
                    changed since that post was written). The classiest way to handle
                    this is to post a new, more complete set of instructions, and
                    explicitly obsolete the old post by mentioning it:</p><pre class="screen">It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  We
saw this problem back in July, and J. Random posted a solution at
http://blahblahblah/blah.  Below is a more complete description of
how to unfrobnicate your indexes, based on J. Random's instructions
but extending them a bit:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Become the user the Scanley server normally runs as.
3. As that user, run the 'defrobnicate' program on the indexes.
4. Run Scanley by hand to see if the indexes work now.
5. Restart the server.
</pre>
                <p>(In an ideal world, it would be possible to attach a note to the
                    old post, saying that there is newer information available and
                    pointing to the new post. However, I don't know of any archiving
                    software that offers an "obsoleted by" tag. This is another reason
                    why creating dedicated web pages with answers to common questions is a
                    good idea.)</p>

                <p>Archives are probably most often searched for answers to
                    technical questions, but their importance to the project goes well
                    beyond that. If a project's formal guidelines are its statutory law,
                    the archives are its common law: a record of all decisions made and
                    how they were arrived at. In any recurring discussion, it's pretty
                    much obligatory nowadays to start with an archive search. This allows
                    you to begin the discussion with a summary of the current state of
                    things, anticipate objections, prepare rebuttals, and possibly
                    discover angles you hadn't thought of. Also, the other participants
                    will <span class="emphasis"><em>expect</em></span> you to have done an archive search.
                    Even if the previous discussions went nowhere, you should include
                    pointers to them when you re-raise the topic, so people can see for
                    themselves a) that they went nowhere, and b) that you did your
                    homework, and therefore are probably saying something now that has not
                    been said before.</p>

                    <p>All of the preceding advice applies to more than just mailing
                        list archives. Having particular pieces of information at stable,
                        conveniently findable addresses should be an organizing principle for
                        all of the project's information. Let's take the project FAQ as a
                        case study.</p>

                    <p>How do people use a FAQ?</p>

                    <div class="orderedlist">
                        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to search in it for specific words and phrases.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to browse it, soaking up information without
                                necessarily looking for answers to specific questions.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They expect search engines such as Google to know about the
                                FAQ's content, so that searches can result in FAQ entries.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to refer other people directly to specific
                                items in the FAQ.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to add new material to the FAQ, but
                                note that this happens much less often than answers are
                                looked upâFAQs are far more often read from than
                                written to.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p><a name="html-named-anchors-and-ids"></a>Point 1 implies that the FAQ
                        should be available in some sort of textual format. Points 2 and 3
                        imply that the FAQ should be available as an HTML page, with point 2
                        additionally indicating that the HTML should be designed for
                        readability (i.e., you'll want some control over its look and feel),
                        and should have a table of contents. Point 4 means that each
                        individual entry in the FAQ should be directly addresseable via a
                        direct URL (e.g., using HTML IDs and named anchors, tags that allow
                        people to reach a particular location on the page). Point 5 means the
                        source files for the FAQ should be available in a convenient way (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#version-everything" title="Version everything">the section called
                            âVersion everythingâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                                                 title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                            <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>), in a format that's
                        easy to edit.</p>

                    <p>Formatting the FAQ like this is just one example of how to make
                        a resource presentable. The same propertiesâdirect
                        searchability, availability to major Internet search engines,
                        browsability, referential stability, and (where applicable)
                        editabilityâapply to other web pages, to the source code tree,
                        to the bug tracker, to Q&amp;A forums, etc. It just happens that most
                        mailing list archiving software long ago recognized the importance of
                        these properties, which is why mailing lists tend to have this
                        functionality natively, while other formats may require a little extra
                        effort on the maintainer's part. <a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers"

                <p>As a project acquires history and complexity, the amount of data
                    each new incoming participant must absorb increases. Those who have been
                    with the project a long time were able to learn, and invent, the
                    project's conventions as they went along. They will often not be
                    consciously aware of what a huge body of tradition has accumulated, and
                    may be surprised at how many missteps recent newcomers seem to make.
                    Of course, the issue is not that the newcomers are of any lower
                    quality than before; it's that they face a bigger acculturation burden
                    than newcomers did in the past.</p>

                <p>The traditions a project accumulates are as much about how to
                    communicate and preserve information as they are about coding
                    standards and other technical minutae. We've already looked at both
                    sorts of standards, in
                    <a class="xref" href="#developer-documentation" title="Developer documentation">the section called
                        âDeveloper documentationâ</a><span>

                        Started</i></a></span> and
                    <a class="xref" href="#written-rules" title="Writing It All Down">the section called âWriting It All
                        Downâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span> respectively, and
                    examples are given there. What this section is about is how to keep
                    such guidelines up-to-date as the project evolves, especially
                    guidelines about how communications are managed, because those are the
                    ones that change the most as the project grows in size and
                    complexity.</p>

                <p>First, watch for patterns in how people get confused. If you
                    see the same situations coming up over and over, especially with new
                    participants, chances are there is a guideline that needs to be
                    documented but isn't. Second, don't get tired of saying the same
                    things over and over again, and don't <span class="emphasis"><em>sound</em></span> like
                    you're tired of saying them. You and other project veterans will have
                    to repeat yourselves often; this is an inevitable side effect of the
                    arrival of newcomers.</p>

                <p>Every web page, every mailing list message, and every IRC channel
                    should be considered advertising spaceânot for commercial
                    advertisements, but for ads about your project's own resources. What
                    you put in that space depends on the demographics of those likely to
                    read it. An IRC channel for user questions, for example, is likely to
                    get people who have never interacted with the project
                    beforeâoften someone who has just installed the software, and
                    has a question he'd like answered immediately (after all, if it
                    could wait, he'd have sent it to a mailing list instead, which would
                    probably use less of his total time, although it would take longer
                    for an answer to come back). Most people don't make a permanent
                    investment in a support IRC channel; they'll show up, ask their question,
                    and leave.</p>

                <p>Therefore, the channel topic should be aimed at people looking
                    for technical answers about the software <span class="emphasis"><em>right
                        now</em></span>, rather than at, say, people who might get involved
                    with the project in a long term way and for whom community interaction
                    guidelines might be more appropriate. Here's how a really busy
                    channel handles it (compare this with the earlier example in
                    <a class="xref" href="#irc" title="IRC / Real-Time Chat Systems">the section called âIRC / Real-Time

                <p>With mailing lists, the "ad space" is a tiny footer appended to
                    every message. Most projects put subscription/unsubscription
                    instructions there, and perhaps a pointer to the project's home page
                    or FAQ page as well. You might think that anyone subscribed to the
                    list would know where to find those things, and they probably
                    doâbut many more people than just subscribers see those mailing
                    list messages. An archived post may be linked to from many places;
                    indeed, some posts become so widely known that they eventually have
                    more readers off the list than on it.</p>

                <p>Formatting can make a big difference. For example, in the
                    Subversion project, we were having limited success using the
                    bug-filtering technique described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">the section called
                        âPre-Filtering the Bug Trackerâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>. Many bogus
                    bug reports were still being filed by inexperienced people, and each
                    time it happened, the filer had to be educated in exactly the same way
                    as the 500 people before him. One day, after one of our developers had
                    finally gotten to the end of his rope and flamed some poor user who
                    didn't read the ticket tracker guidelines carefully enough, another
                    developer decided this pattern had gone on long enough. He suggested
                    that we reformat the ticket tracker front page so that the most
                    important part, the injunction to discuss the bug on the mailing lists
                    or IRC channels before filing, would stand out in huge, bold red
                    letters, on a bright yellow background, centered prominently above
                    everything else on the page. We did so (it's been reformatted a bit
                    since then, but it's still very prominentâyou can see the results at

                    <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html" target="_top">subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html</a>),
                    and
                    the result was a noticeable drop in the rate of bogus ticket filings.
                    The project still gets them, of courseâit always willâbut the rate
                    has slowed considerably, even as the number of users increases. The
                    outcome is not only that the bug database contains less junk, but that
                    those who respond to ticket filings stay in a better mood, and are more
                    likely to remain friendly when responding to one of the now-rare bogus
                    filings. This improves both the project's image and the mental health
                    of its participants.</p>

                <p>The lesson for us was that merely writing up the guidelines was
                    not enough. We also had to put them where they'd be seen by those who
                    need them most, and format them in such a way that their status as
                    introductory material would be immediately clear to people unfamiliar
                    with the project.</p>

                <p>Static web pages are not the only venue for advertising the
                    project's customs. A certain amount of interactive policing (in the
                    friendly-reminder sense, not the handcuffs-and-jail sense) is also
                    required. All peer review, even the commit reviews described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the section called
                        âPractice Conspicuous Code Reviewâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>, should include review
                    of people's conformance or non-conformance with project norms,
                    especially with regard to communications conventions.</p>

                <p>Another example from the Subversion project: we settled on a
                    convention of "r12908" to mean "revision 12908 in the version control
                    repository." The lower-case "r" prefix is easy to type, and because
                    it's half the height of the digits, it makes an easily-recognizable
                    block of text when combined with the digits. Of course, settling on
                    the convention doesn't mean that everyone will begin using it

Patch from J. Random Contributor &lt;jrcontrib@gmail.com&gt;

* trunk/contrib/client-side/psvn/psvn.el:
  Fixed some typos from revision 12828.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
                <p>...part of reviewing that commit is to say "By the way, please
                    use 'r12828', not 'revision 12828' when referring to past changes."
                    This isn't just pedantry; it's important as much for automatic
                    parsability as for human readership.</p>

                <p>By following the general principle that there should be
                    canonical referral methods for common entities, and that these
                    referral methods should be used consistently everywhere, the project
                    in effect exports certain standards. Those standards enable people to
                    write tools that present the project's communications in more useable
                    waysâfor example, a revision formatted as "r12828" could be
                    transformed into a live link into the repository browsing system.
                    This would be harder to do if the revision were written as "revision
                    12828", both because that form could be divided across a line break,
                    and because it's less distinct (the word "revision" will often appear
                    alone, and groups of numbers will often appear alone, whereas the
                    combination "r12828" can only mean a revision number). Similar
                    concerns apply to ticket numbers, FAQ items, etc.</p>

                <p>Even for entities where there is not an obvious short, canonical
                    form, people should still be encouraged to provide key pieces of
                    information consistently. For example, when referring to a mailing
                    list message, don't just give the sender and subject; also give the
                    archive URL <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the Message-ID header. The last
                    allows people who have their own copy of the mailing list (people
                    sometimes keep offline copies, for example to use on a laptop while
                    traveling) to unambiguously identify the right message in a search even if they
                    don't have access to the archives. The sender and subject wouldn't be
                    enough, because the same person might make several posts in the same
                    thread, even on the same day.</p>

                <p>The more a project grows, the more important this sort of
                    consistency becomes. Consistency means that everywhere people look,
                    they see the same patterns being followed, and start to follow
                    those patterns themselves. This, in turn, reduces the number of
                    questions they need to ask. The burden of having a million readers is
                    no greater than that of having one; scalability problems start to
                    arise only when a certain percentage of those readers ask questions.
                    As a project grows, therefore, it must reduce that percentage by
                    increasing the density and findability of information, so that any
                    given person is more likely to find what he needs without having to
                    ask.</p></div>

            <p>One of the trickiest things about managing an open source
                project is getting people to be thoughtful about which forum they
                choose for different kinds of communications. It's tricky partly
                because it's not immediately obvious that it matters. During any
                given conversation, the participants are mostly concerned with what
                the people involved are saying, and won't usually stop to think about
                whether or not the forum itself gives others who
                <span class="emphasis"><em>might</em></span> want to take part the opportunity to do
                so.</p>

            <p>For example, a real-time forum like IRC is terrific for quick
                questions, for opportunistic synchronization of work, for reminding
                someone of something they promised to do, etc. But it's not a good
                forum for making decisions that affect the whole project, because the
                people who take part in a conversation in IRC are just whoever
                happened to be in the channel at that moment&nbsp;â&nbsp;it's
                very dependent on work schedules, time zones, etc. On the other hand,
                the development mailing list is a great place for making formal
                project-wide decisions, since every interested party will have an
                opportunity to see and respond to the relevant posts, even though it's
                not as well-suited to quick, real-time interactions as IRC is.</p>

            <p>Another example comes up frequently in bug tracker usage,
                especially in the last few years as bug trackers have become so well
                integrated with email. Sometimes people will be drawn into a
                discussion in a bug ticket<sup>[<a name="idp8043904" href="#ftn.idp8043904"
                                                   class="footnote">49</a>]</sup> and because they simply see
                project-related
                emails coming in to their email client, they treat the discussion as
                though it's happening on the real development list. But it's not:
                anyone who wasn't watching that bug and wasn't explicitly invited into
                the conversation won't even be aware it's happening. If things are
                discussed in that bug ticket that go beyond the scope of just that one
                bug, they'll be discussed without input from people who should at
                least have had a chance to participate.</p>

            <p>The solution to this is to encourage conscious, intentional
                forum changes. If a discussion starts to get into questions beyond
                the scope of its original forum, then at some point someone involved
                should ask that the conversation move over to the main development
                list or some other wider forum.</p>

            <p>It's not enough for you to do this on your own. You have to
                create a culture where it's normal for everyone to do it, so everyone
                thinks about forum appropriateness as a matter of course, and feels
                comfortable raising questions of forum whenever necessary in any
                discussion. Obviously, documenting the practice will help (see <a class="xref" href="#written-rules"
                                                                                  title="Writing It All Down">the
                    section called âWriting It All Downâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure"
                                                                         title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>), but you'll probably also
                need to remind people of it often, especially when your project is
                starting out. A good rule of thumb is: if the conversation looks
                convergent, then it's okay to keep it in the bug ticket or other
                original forum. But if it looks likely to diverge for a while (e.g.,
                widening into philosophical issues about how the software should
                behave, or raising design issues that go beyond just the one bug)
                before it converges, then take the discussion to a broader forum,
                usually the development mailing list.</p>

                </div>
                <p>When a discussion moves from one place to another, cross-link
                    between the old and new place. For example, if discussion moves from
                    the ticket tracker to the mailing list, link to the mailing list
                    thread from the ticket, and mention the original ticket at the start
                    of the new list thread. It's important for someone following the
                    ticket to be able to reach the later discussion; it's also important
                    for someone who encounters the ticket a year later to be able to
                    follow to where the conversation went to in the mailing list archives.
                    The person who does the move may find this cross-linking slightly
                    laborious, but open source is fundamentally a writer-responsible
                    culture. It's more important to make things easy for the tens or
                    hundreds of people who may read the bug than for the three or five
                    people writing about it.</p>

                <p>It's also fine to take important conclusions or summaries from
                    the list discussion and paste them into the ticket at the end, if that
                    will make things convenient for readers. A common idiom is to move
                    discussion to the mailing list, put a link to that thread in the
                    ticket, and then when the discussion finishes, paste the final summary
                    into the ticket (along with a link to the message containing that
                    summary), so someone browsing the ticket later can easily see what
                    conclusion was reached without having to click to somewhere else or do
                    detective work. Note that the usual "two masters" data duplication
                    problem does not exist here, because both archives and ticket comments
                    are usually static, unchangeable data anyway.</p></div>

            <p>In free software, there is a fairly smooth continuum between
                purely internal discussions and public relations statements. This is
                partly because the target audience is always ill-defined: given that
                most or all posts are publicly accessible, the project doesn't have
                full control over the impression the world gets. Someoneâsay, a
                <a class="ulink" href="http://slashdot.org/" target="_top">slashdot.org</a>
                editorâmay draw millions of readers' attention to a post that no
                one ever expected to be seen outside the project. This is a fact of
                life that all open source projects live with, but in practice, the
                risk is usually small. In general, the announcements that the project
                most wants publicized are the ones that will be most publicized,
                assuming you use the right mechanisms to indicate relative
                newsworthiness to the outside world.</p>

            <p>For major announcements, there tend to be a few main channels of
                distribution, on which announcements should be made as nearly
                simultaneously as possible:</p>

            <div class="orderedlist">
                <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Your project's front page is probably seen by more
                        people than any other part of the project. If you have a
                        really major announcement, put a blurb there. The blurb
                        should be a very brief synopsis that links to the press
                        release (see below) for more information.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>At the same time, you should also have a "News" or
                        "Press Releases" area of the web site, where the
                        announcement can be written up in detail. Part of the
                        purpose of a press release is to provide a single,
                        canonical "announcement object" that other sites can link
                        to, so make sure it is structured accordingly: either as
                        one web page per release, as a discrete blog entry, or
                        as some other kind of entity that can be linked to while
                        still being kept distinct from other press releases in the
                        same area.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Make sure the announcement gets broadcast by any
                        relevant Twitter handles, and goes out on any news
                        channels or RSS feeds. (The latter may happen
                        automatically when you publish announcement, depending on
                        how things are set up at your site.)</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>If the announcement is about a new release of the
                        software, then update your project's entry on
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://freecode.com/" target="_top">freecode.com</a> (see

                        creating the entry
                        in the first place). Every time you update a Freecode
                        entry, that entry goes onto the Freecode change list
                        for the day. The change list is updated not only on
                        Freecode itself, but on various portal sites (including
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://slashdot.org" target="_top">slashdot.org</a>)
                        which are watched eagerly by
                        hordes of people. Freecode also offers the same data via
                        RSS feed, so people who are not subscribed to your
                        project's own RSS feed might still see the announcement
                        via Freecode's.</p></li>

                        Unlike

                        readers agree with you, your announcement will end up on
                        the front page. Please use some judgement: if your
                        project is not in wide usage yet and there is not some
                        specific reason why this announcement would be interesting
                        to that audience, don't waste their time with it. There's
                        little point for an open source project to compete in a
                        marketing arms race. Accurate and well-targeted
                        announcements are your best strategy. (Similar advice

                        abuse itâconsider carefully before posting). To
                        avoid random people making announcements, or worse, spam
                        getting through, the <code class="literal">announce</code> list must
                        always be moderated.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Don't forget to <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/" target="_top">tweet</a>
                        (and/or dent at <a class="ulink" href="https://identi.ca/" target="_top">identi.ca</a>, etc, if
                        you
                        use other microblog sites besides Twitter).</p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Try to make the announcements in all these places at the same
                time, as nearly as possible. People might get confused if they see an
                announcement on the mailing list but then don't see it reflected on
                the project's home page or in its press releases area. If you get the
                various changes (emails, web page edits, etc.) queued up and
                then send them all in a row, you can keep the window of inconsistency
                very small.</p>

            <p>For a less important event, you can eliminate some or all of the
                above outlets. The event will still be noticed by the outside world
                in direct proportion to its importance. For example, while a new
                release of the software is a major event, merely setting the date of
                the next release, while still somewhat newsworthy, is not nearly as
                important as the release itself. Setting a date is worth an email to
                the daily mailing lists (not the announce list), and an update of the
                project's timeline or status web page, but no more.</p>

            <p>However, you might still see that date appearing in discussions
                elsewhere on the Internet, wherever there are people interested in the
                project. People who are lurkers on your mailing lists, just listening
                and never saying anything, are not necessarily silent elsewhere. Word
                of mouth gives very broad distribution; you should count on it, and
                construct even minor announcements in such a way as to encourage
                accurate informal transmission. Specifically, posts that you expect
                to be quoted should have a clearly meant-to-be-quoted portion, just as
                though you were writing a formal press release. For example:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Just a progress update: we're planning to
                    release
                    version 2.0 of Scanley in mid-August 2005. You can always check
                    http://www.scanley.org/status.html for updates. The major new
                    feature will be regular-expression searches.</em></span></p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Other new features include:&nbsp;... There will
                        also be various bugfixes, including:&nbsp;...</em></span></p></blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>The first paragraph is short, gives the two most important
                pieces of information (the release date and the major new feature),
                and a URL to visit for further news. If that paragraph is the only
                thing that crosses someone's screen, you're still doing pretty well.
                The rest of the mail could be lost without affecting the gist of the
                content. Of course, sometimes people will link to the entire mail
                anyway, but just as often, they'll quote only a small part. Given that
                the latter is a possibility, you might as well make it easy for them,
                and in the bargain get some influence over what gets quoted.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">
                <div class="titlepage">

                </div>
                <p>Handling a security vulnerability is different from handling any
                    other kind of bug report. In free software, doing things openly and
                    transparently is normally almost a religious credo. Every step of the
                    standard bug-handling process is visible to all who care to watch: the
                    arrival of the initial report, the ensuing discussion, and the
                    eventual fix.</p>

                <p>Security bugs are different. They can compromise users' data,
                    and possibly users' entire computers. To discuss such a problem
                    openly would be to advertise its existence to the entire
                    worldâincluding to all the parties who might make malicious use
                    of the bug. Even merely committing a fix effectively announces the
                    bug's existence (there are potential attackers who watch the commit
                    logs of public projects, systematically looking for changes that
                    indicate security problems in the pre-change code). Most open source
                    projects have settled on approximately the same set of steps to handle
                    this conflict between openness and secrecy, based on the these basic
                    guidelines:</p>

                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Don't talk about the bug publicly until a fix is
                            available; then supply the fix (packaged as a release) at
                            exactly the same moment you announce the bug.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Come up with that fix as fast as you
                            canâespecially if someone outside the project
                            reported the bug, because then you know there's at least
                            one person outside the project who is able to exploit the
                            vulnerability.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>In practice, those principles lead to a fairly standardized
                    series of steps, which are described in the sections below.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Receive the report">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-receiving"></a>Receive the report</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Obviously, a project needs the ability to receive security bug
                        reports from anyone. But the regular bug reporting channels won't do,
                        because they can be watched by anyone too. Therefore, have a separate
                        mailing list or contact form for receiving security bug reports. That
                        forum must not have publicly readable archives, and its subscribership must
                        be strictly controlledâonly long-time, trusted developers can be
                        on the list. If you need a formal definition of "trusted", you can
                        use "anyone who has had commit access for two years or more" or
                        something like that, to avoid favoritism. This is the group that will
                        handle security bugs.</p>

                    <p>Ideally, the security list should not be spam-protected or
                        moderated, since you don't want an important report to get filtered
                        out or delayed just because no moderators happened to be online that
                        weekend. If you do use automated spam-protection software, try to
                        configure it with high-tolerance settings; it's better to let a few spams
                        through than to miss a vulnerability report.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Develop the fix quietly">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-finding-a-fix"></a>Develop the fix quietly</h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>So what does the security list do when it receives a report?
                        The first task is to evaluate the problem's severity and
                        urgency:</p>

                    <div class="orderedlist">
                        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                            <li class="listitem"><p>How serious is the vulnerability? Does it allow a
                                malicious attacker to take over the computer of someone
                                who uses your software? Or does it, say, merely leak
                                information about the sizes of some of their files?</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability? Can
                                an attack be scripted, or does it require circumstantial
                                knowledge, educated guessing, and luck?</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Who</em></span> reported the problem to
                                you? The answer to this question doesn't change the
                                nature of the vulnerability, of course, but it does give
                                you an idea of how many other people might know about it.
                                If the report comes from one of the project's own
                                developers, you can breathe a little easier (but only a
                                little), because you can trust them not to have told
                                anyone else about it. On the other hand, if it came in an
                                email from <code class="literal">anonymous14@globalhackerz.net</code>,
                                then you'd better act as fast as you can. The person did
                                you a favor by informing you of the problem at all, but you
                                have no idea how many other people she's told, or how long
                                she'll wait before exploiting the vulnerability on live
                                installations.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p>Note that the difference we're talking about here is often just
                        a narrow range between <span class="emphasis"><em>urgent</em></span>
                        and <span class="emphasis"><em>extremely&nbsp;urgent</em></span>. Even when the report
                        comes from a known, friendly source, there could be other people on
                        the Net who discovered the bug long ago and just haven't reported it.
                        The only time things aren't urgent is when the bug inherently does not
                        compromise security very severely.</p>

                    <p>The "<code class="literal">anonymous14@globalhackerz.net</code>" example
                        is not facetious, by the way. You really may get bug reports from
                        identity-cloaked people who, by their words and behavior, never quite
                        clarify whether they're on your side or not. It doesn't matter: if
                        they've reported the security hole to you, they'll feel they've done
                        you a good turn, and you should respond in kind. Thank them for the
                        report, give them a date on or before which you plan to release a
                        public fix, and keep them in the loop. Sometimes they may
                        give <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> a dateâthat is, an implicit threat
                        to publicize the bug on a certain date, whether you're ready or not.
                        This may feel like a bullying power play, but it's more likely a
                        preÃ«mptive action resulting from past disappointment with
                        unresponsive software producers who didn't take security reports
                        seriously enough. Either way, you can't afford to tick this person
                        off. After all, if the bug is severe, she has knowledge that could
                        cause your users big problems. Treat such reporters well, and hope
                        that they treat you well.</p>

                    <p>Another frequent reporter of security bugs is the security
                        professional, someone who audits code for a living and keeps up on the
                        latest news of software vulnerabilities. These people usually have
                        experience on both sides of the fenceâthey've both received and
                        sent reports, probably more than most developers in your project have.
                        They too will usually give a deadline for fixing a vulnerability
                        before going public. The deadline may be somewhat negotiable, but
                        that's up to the reporter; deadlines have become recognized among
                        security professionals as pretty much the only reliable way to get
                        organizations to address security problems promptly. So don't treat
                        the deadline as rude; it's a time-honored tradition, and there are
                        good reasons for it. Negotiate if you absolutely must, but remember
                        that the reporter holds all the cards.</p>

                    <p>Once you know the severity and urgency, you can start working on
                        a fix. There is sometimes a tradeoff between doing a fix elegantly
                        and doing it speedily; this is why you must agree on the urgency
                        before you start. Keep discussion of the fix restricted to the
                        security list members, of course, plus the original reporter (if she
                        wants to be involved) and any developers who need to be brought in for
                        technical reasons.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not commit the fix to any public
                        repository</em></span> before the go-public date. If you were to
                        commit it publicly, even with an
                        innocent-looking log message, someone might notice and understand the
                        change. You never know who is watching your repository and why they
                        might be interested. Turning off commit emails wouldn't help; first
                        of all, the gap in the commit mail sequence would itself look
                        suspicious, and anyway, the data would still be in the repository.
                        Just do all development in some private place known only to the people
                        already aware of the bug.</p></div>

                        sources appearing as cryptic abbreviations. A key to those

                    <p>If your vulnerability meets the criteria, you may wish to obtain
                        a CVE number for it. You can request one using the instructions at
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html" target="_top">cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html</a>,
                        but if there is someone in
                        your project who has already obtained CVE numbers, or who knows
                        someone who has, let them do it. The CVE Editorial Board gets a lot of
                        submissions, many of them spurious or poorly written submissions; by
                        approaching them through a trusted source, you are saving them time
                        and possibly getting your CVE number assigned more quickly. The other
                        advantage of doing it this way is that somewhere along the chain,
                        someone may know enough to tell you that a) it wouldn't count as a
                        vulnerability or exposure according to MITRE's criteria, so there is
                        no point submitting it, or b) the vulnerability already
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> a CVE number. The latter can happen if the
                        bug has already been published on another security advisory list, for
                        example at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cert.org/" target="_top">www.cert.org</a> or
                        on the BugTraq mailing list at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/"
                                                          target="_top">www.securityfocus.com</a>.
                        (If that happened without your project hearing about it, then you
                        should worry what else might be going on that you don't know
                        about.)</p>

                    <p>If you get a CVE number at all, you usually want to get it in
                        the early stages of your bug investigation, so that all further
                        communications can refer to that number. CVE entries are embargoed
                        until the go-public date: the number will be reserved, but MITRE will
                        allow some time (within reason) before revealing information about the
                        vulnerability&nbsp;â&nbsp;so make sure you or your intermediary
                        communicate clearly with the CVE Editorial Board about how long you
                        need before publicly announcing.</p>

                    <p>Once your security response team (that is, those developers who
                        are on the security mailing list, or who have been brought in to deal
                        with a particular report) has a fix ready, you need to decide how to
                        distribute it.</p>

                    <p>If you simply commit the fix to your repository, or otherwise
                        announce it to the world, you effectively force everyone using your
                        software to upgrade immediately or risk being hacked. It is sometimes
                        appropriate, therefore, to do <em class="firstterm">pre-notification</em>
                        for certain important users. This is particularly true with
                        client/server software, where there may be well-known services using
                        your software and who are tempting targets for attackers. Those
                        service's administrators would appreciate having an extra day or two
                        to do the upgrade, so that they are already protected by the time the
                        exploit becomes public knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Pre-notification simply means sending mails to those
                        administrators before the go-public date, telling them of the
                        vulnerability and how to fix it. You should send pre-notification
                        only to people you trust to be discreet with the information, and with
                        whom you can communicate securely. That is, the qualification for
                        receiving pre-notification is threefold: the recipient must run a
                        large, important service where a compromise would be a serious matter;
                        the recipient must be known to be someone who won't blab about the
                        security problem before the go-public date; and you must have a way
                        (such as via <a class="ulink" href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_top">GnuPG</a>-encrypted
                        email) to communicate securely with the recipient, so that any
                        eavesdroppers between you and your recipient can't read the
                        message.<sup>[<a name="idp8128448" href="#ftn.idp8128448" class="footnote">51</a>]</sup></p>

                    <p>Send each pre-notification mail individually (one at a time) to
                        each recipient. Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send to the entire list
                        of recipients at once, because then they would see each others'
                        namesâmeaning that you would essentially be alerting each
                        recipient to the fact that each <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> recipient
                        may have a security hole in her service. Sending it to them all via
                        blind CC (BCC) isn't a good solution either, because some admins
                        protect their inboxes with spam filters that either block or reduce
                        the priority of BCC'd mail, since so much spam is sent via BCC. If
                        you have a phone number or other out-of-band way to contact the
                        administrator to let them know the mail is coming, use it.</p>

                    <p>Here's a sample pre-notification mail:</p><pre class="screen">From: Your Name Here
To: admin@large-famous-server.com
Reply-to: Your Name Here (not the security list's address)
Subject: Confidential vulnerability notification.

[[[ BEGIN ENCRYPTED MAIL ]]]

This email is a confidential pre-notification of a security alert
in the Scanley server software.

Please *do not forward* any part of this mail to anyone.  The public
announcement is not until May 19th, and we'd like to keep the
information embargoed until then.

You are receiving this mail because (we think) you run a Scanley
server, and would want to have it patched before this security hole is
made public on May 19th.

References:
===========

   CVE-2015-892346: Scanley stack overflow in queries

Vulnerability:
==============

   The server can be made to run arbitrary commands if the server's
   locale is misconfigured and the client sends a malformed query.

Severity:
=========

   Very severe; can involve arbitrary code execution on the server.

Workarounds:
============

   Setting the 'natural-language-processing' option to 'off' in
   scanley.conf closes this vulnerability.

Patch:
======

   The patch below applies to Scanley 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.

   A new public release (Scanley 3.2.1) will be made on or just before
   May 19th, so that it is available at the same time as this
   vulnerability is made public.  You can patch now, or just wait for
   the public release.  The only difference between 3.2 and 3.2.1 will
   be this patch.

[...patch goes here...]
</pre>
                    <p>If you have a CVE number, include it in the pre-notification (as
                        shown above), even though the information is still embargoed and
                        therefore the corresponding MITRE page will show nothing at the time
                        of pre-notification. Including the CVE number allows the recipient to
                        know with certainty that the bug they were pre-notified about is the
                        same one they later hear about through public channels, so they don't
                        have to worry whether further action is necessary or not, which is
                        precisely the point of CVE numbers.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Distribute the fix publicly">
                    <div class="titlepage">

                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-announcing"></a>Distribute the fix publicly</h4>

                    </div>
                    <p>The last step in handling a security bug is to distribute the
                        fix publicly. In a single, comprehensive announcement, you should
                        describe the problem, give the CVE number if any, describe how to
                        work around it, and how to permanently fix it. Usually "fix" means
                        upgrading to a new version of the software, though sometimes it can
                        mean applying a patch, particularly if the software is normally run in
                        source form anyway. If you do make a new release, it should differ
                        from some existing release by exactly the security patch. That way,
                        conservative admins can upgrade without worrying about what else they
                        might be affecting; they also don't have to worry about future upgrades,
                        because the security fix will be in all future releases as a matter of
                        course. (Details of release procedures are discussed in
                        <a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called âSecurity
                            Releasesâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Chapter&nbsp;7,
    <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>.)</p>

                    <p>Whether or not the public fix involves a new release, do the
                        announcement with roughly the same priority as you would a new
                        release: send a mail to the project's <code class="literal">announce</code>
                        list, make a new press release, etc. While you should never try to
                        play down the existence of a security bug out of concern for the
                        project's reputation, you may certainly set the tone and prominence of
                        a security announcement to match the actual severity of the problem.
                        If the security hole is just a minor information exposure, not an
                        exploit that allows the user's entire computer to be taken over, then
                        it may not warrant a lot of fuss. You may even decide not to distract
                        the <code class="literal">announce</code> list with it. After all, if the
                        project cries wolf every time, users might end up thinking the
                        software is less secure than it actually is, and also might not
                        believe you when you have a really big problem to announce. See
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html" target="_top">cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html</a>

                        to the problem of judging and describing severity.</p>

                    <p>In general, if you're unsure how to treat a security problem,
                        find someone with experience and talk to them about it. Assessing and
                        handling vulnerabilities is very much an acquired skill, and it's easy
                        to make missteps the first few times.</p></div>

            <p>This chapter is about how free software projects package and
                release their software, and how overall development patterns organize
                around those goals.</p>

            <p>A major difference between open source projects and proprietary
                ones is the lack of centralized control over the development team.
                When a new release is being prepared, this difference is especially
                stark: a corporation can ask its entire development team to focus on
                an upcoming release, putting aside new feature development and
                non-critical bug fixing until the release is done. Volunteer groups
                are not so monolithic. People work on the project for all sorts of
                reasons, and those not interested in helping with a given release
                still want to continue regular development work while the release is
                going on. Because development doesn't stop, open source release
                processes tend to take longer, but be less disruptive, than commercial
                release processes. It's a bit like highway repair. There are two
                ways to fix a road: you can shut it down completely, so that a repair
                crew can swarm all over it at full capacity until the problem is
                solved, or you can work on a couple of lanes at a time, while leaving the
                others open to traffic. The first way is very efficient <span class="emphasis"><em>for
                    the repair crew</em></span>, but not for anyone elseâthe road is
                entirely shut down until the job is done. The second way involves
                much more time and trouble for the repair crew (now they have to work
                with fewer people and less equipment, in cramped conditions, with
                flaggers to slow and direct traffic, etc.), but at least the road
                remains useable, albeit not at full capacity.</p>

            <p>Open source projects tend to work the second way. In fact, for
                a mature piece of software with several different release lines being
                maintained simultaneously, the project is sort of in a permanent state
                of minor road repair. There are always a couple of lanes closed; a
                consistent but low level of background inconvenience is always being
                tolerated by the development group as a whole, so that releases get
                made on a regular schedule.</p>

            <p>The model that makes this possible generalizes to more than just
                releases. It's the principle of parallelizing tasks that are not
                mutually interdependentâa principle that is by no means unique
                to open source development, of course, but one which open source
                projects implement in their own particular way. They cannot afford to
                annoy either the roadwork crew or the regular traffic too much, but
                they also cannot afford to have people dedicated to standing by the
                orange cones and flagging traffic along. Thus they gravitate toward
                processes that have flat, constant levels of administrative overhead,
                rather than peaks and valleys. Volunteers are generally willing to
                work with small but consistent amounts of inconvenience; the
                predictability allows them to come and go without worrying about
                whether their schedule will clash with what's happening in the
                project. But if the project were subject to a master schedule in
                which some activities excluded other activities, the result would be a
                lot of developers sitting idle a lot of the timeâwhich would be
                not only inefficient but boring, and therefore dangerous, in that a
                bored developer is likely to soon be an ex-developer.</p>

            <p>Release work is usually the most noticeable non-development task
                that happens in parallel with development, so the methods described in
                the following sections are geared mostly toward enabling releases.
                However, note that they also apply to other parallelizable tasks, such
                as translations and internationalization, broad API changes made
                gradually across the entire code base, etc.</p></div>

            <p>Before we talk about how to make a release, let's look at how to
                name releases, which requires knowing what releases actually mean to
                users. A release means that:</p>

            <div class="itemizedlist">
                <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Some old bugs have been fixed. This is probably the one
                        thing users can count on being true of every release.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>New bugs have been added. This too can usually
                        be counted on, except sometimes in the case of security
                        releases or other one-offs (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called âSecurity
                            Releasesâ</a><span> later in this chapter</span>).</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>New features may have been added.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>New configuration options may have been added, or
                        the meanings of old options may have changed subtly. The
                        installation procedures may have changed slightly since
                        the last release too, though one always hopes not.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Incompatible changes may have been introduced, for
                        example such
                        that the data formats used by older versions of the
                        software are no longer useable without undergoing some
                        sort of (possibly manual) one-way conversion step.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>As you can see, not all of these are good things. This is why
                experienced users approach new releases with some trepidation,
                especially when the software is mature and was already mostly doing
                what they wanted (or thought they wanted). Even the arrival of new
                features is a mixed blessing, in that it may mean the software
                will now behave in unexpected ways.</p>

            <p>The purpose of release numbering, therefore, is twofold:
                obviously the numbers should unambiguously communicate the ordering of
                releases (i.e., by looking at any two releases' numbers, one can know
                which came later), but also they should indicate as compactly as
                possible the degree and nature of the changes in the release.</p>

            <p>All that in a number? Well, more or less, yes. Release
                numbering strategies are one of the oldest bikeshed discussions around
                (see <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">the section
                    called âThe Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debateâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>),
                and the world is
                unlikely to settle on a single, complete standard anytime soon.
                However, a few good strategies have emerged, along with one
                universally agreed-on principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>be consistent</em></span>.
                Pick a numbering scheme, document it, and stick with it. Your users
                will thank you.</p>

                <p>This section describes the formal conventions of release
                    numbering in detail, and assumes very little prior knowledge. It is
                    intended mainly as a reference. If you're already familiar with these
                    conventions, you can skip this section.</p>

                <p>Release numbers are groups of digits separated by dots:</p>

                <p>...and so on. The dots are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> decimal
                    points, they are merely separators; "5.3.9" would be followed by
                    "5.3.10". A few projects have occasionally hinted otherwise, most
                    famously the Linux kernel with its "0.95", "0.96"... "0.99" sequence
                    leading up to Linux 1.0, but the convention that the dots are not
                    decimals is now firmly established and should be considered a
                    standard. There is no limit to the number of components (digit
                    portions containing no dots), but most projects do not go beyond three
                    or four. The reasons why will become clear later.</p>

                <p>In addition to the numeric components, projects sometimes tack
                    on a descriptive label such as "Alpha" or "Beta" (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#alpha-and-beta" title="Alpha and Beta">Alpha and Beta</a>), for example:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha)<br>
                        Singer&nbsp;5.11.4&nbsp;(Beta)</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>An Alpha or Beta qualifier means that this
                    release <span class="emphasis"><em>precedes</em></span> a future release that will have
                    the same number without the qualifier. Thus, "2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha)"
                    leads eventually to "2.3.0". In order to allow several such candidate
                    releases in a row, the qualifiers themselves can have meta-qualifiers.
                    For example, here is a series of releases in the order that they would
                    be made available to the public:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha&nbsp;1)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha&nbsp;2)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Beta&nbsp;1)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Beta&nbsp;2)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Beta&nbsp;3)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>Notice that when it has the "Alpha" qualifier, Scanley "2.3" is
                    written as "2.3.0". The two numbers are equivalentâtrailing
                    all-zero components can always be dropped for brevityâbut when a
                    qualifier is present, brevity is out the window anyway, so one might
                    as well go for completeness instead.</p>

                <p>Other qualifiers in semi-regular use include "Stable",
                    "Unstable", "Development", and "RC" (for "Release Candidate"). The
                    most widely used ones are still "Alpha" and "Beta", with "RC" running
                    a close third place, but note that "RC" always includes a numeric
                    meta-qualifier. That is, you don't release
                    "Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(RC)", you release
                    "Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(RC&nbsp;1)", followed by RC2, etc.</p>

                <p>Those three labels, "Alpha", "Beta", and "RC", are pretty widely
                    known now, and I don't recommend using any of the others, even though
                    the others might at first glance seem like better choices because they
                    are normal words, not jargon. But people who install software from
                    releases are already familiar with the big three, and there's no
                    reason to do things gratuitously differently from the way everyone
                    else does them.</p>

                <p>Although the dots in release numbers are not decimal points,
                    they do indicate place-value significance. All "0.X.Y" releases
                    precede "1.0" (which is equivalent to "1.0.0", of course). "3.14.158"
                    immediately precedes "3.14.159", and non-immediately precedes
                    "3.14.160" as well as "3.15.anything", and so.</p>

                <p>A consistent release numbering policy enables a user to look at
                    two release numbers for the same piece of software and tell, just from
                    the numbers, the important differences between those two releases. In
                    a typical three-component system, the first component is
                    the <em class="firstterm">major&nbsp;number</em>, the second is
                    the <em class="firstterm">minor&nbsp;number</em>, and the third is the
                    <em class="firstterm">micro&nbsp;number</em>. For example, release
                    "2.10.17" is the eighteenth micro release in the eleventh minor release
                    line within the second major release series<sup>[<a name="idp8514624" href="#ftn.idp8514624"
                                                                        class="footnote">52</a>]</sup>. The words "line"
                    and
                    "series" are used informally here, but they mean what one would
                    expect: a major series is simply all the releases that share the same
                    major number, and a minor series (or minor line) consists of all the releases
                    that share the same minor <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> major number. That
                    is, "2.4.0" and "3.4.1" are not in the same minor series,
                    even though they both have "4" for their minor number; on the other
                    hand, "2.4.0" and "2.4.2" are in the same minor line, though they are
                    not adjacent if "2.4.1" was released between them.</p>

                <p>The meanings of these numbers themselves are also roughly what
                    you'd expect: an
                    increment of the major number indicates that major changes happened;
                    an increment of the minor number indicates minor changes; and an
                    increment of the micro number indicates really trivial changes. Some
                    projects add a fourth component, usually called
                    the <em class="firstterm">patch&nbsp;number</em>, for especially
                    fine-grained control over the differences between their releases
                    (confusingly, other projects use "patch" as a synonym for "micro" in a
                    three-component system). There are also projects that use the last
                    component as a <em class="firstterm">build&nbsp;number</em>, incremented
                    every time the software is built and representing no change other than
                    that build. This helps the project link every bug report with a
                    specific build, and is probably most useful when binary packages are
                    the default method of distribution.</p>

                <p>Although there are many different conventions for how many
                    components to use, and what the components mean, the differences tend
                    to be minorâyou get a little leeway, but not a lot. The next
                    two sections discuss some of the most widely used conventions.</p></div>

                <p>Most projects have rules about what kinds of changes are allowed
                    into a release if one is only incrementing the micro number, different
                    rules for the minor number, and still different ones for the major
                    number. There is no set standard for these rules yet, but here I will
                    describe a policy that has been used successfully by multiple
                    projects. You may want to just adopt this policy in your own
                    project, but even if you don't, it's still a good example of the kind
                    of information release numbers should convey. This policy is adapted
                    from the numbering system used by the APR project, see
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html" target="_top">apr.apache.org/versioning.html</a>.

                            new features in a minor release, but usually not too many

                <p>What <em class="firstterm">backward-compatible</em>
                    and <em class="firstterm">forward-compatible</em> mean, exactly, depends on
                    what your software does, but in context they are usually not open to
                    much interpretation. For example, if your project is a client/server
                    application, then "backward-compatible" means that upgrading the
                    server to 2.6.0 should not cause any existing 2.5.4 clients to lose
                    functionality or behave differently than they did before (except for
                    bugs that were fixed, of course). On the other hand, upgrading one of
                    those clients to 2.6.0, along with the server, might
                    make <span class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> functionality available for that client,
                    functionality that 2.5.4 clients don't know how to take advantage of.
                    If that happens, then the upgrade is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
                    "forward-compatible": clearly you can't now downgrade that client
                    back to 2.5.4 and keep all the functionality it had at 2.6.0, since
                    some of that functionality was new in 2.6.0.</p>

                <p>This is why micro releases are essentially for bug fixes only.
                    They must remain compatible in both directions: if you upgrade from
                    2.5.3 to 2.5.4, then change your mind and downgrade back to 2.5.3, no
                    functionality should be lost. Of course, the bugs fixed in 2.5.4
                    would reappear after the downgrade, but you wouldn't lose any
                    features, except insofar as the restored bugs prevent the use of some
                    existing features.</p>

                <p>Client/server protocols are just one of many possible
                    compatibility domains. Another is data formats: does the software
                    write data to permanent storage? If so, the formats it reads and
                    writes need to follow the compatibility guidelines promised by the
                    release number policy. Version 2.6.0 needs to be able to read the
                    files written by 2.5.4, but may silently upgrade the format to
                    something that 2.5.4 cannot read, because the ability to downgrade is
                    not required across a minor number boundary. If your project
                    distributes code libraries for other programs to use, then APIs are a
                    compatibility domain too: you must make sure that source and binary
                    compatibility rules are spelled out in such a way that the informed
                    user need never wonder whether or not it's safe to upgrade in place.
                    She will be able to look at the numbers and know instantly.</p>

                <p>In this system, you don't get a chance for a fresh start until
                    you increment the major number. This can often be a real
                    inconvenience: there may be features you wish to add, or protocols
                    that you wish to redesign, that simply cannot be done while
                    maintaining compatibility. There's no magic solution to this, except
                    to try to design things in an extensible way in the first place (a
                    topic easily worth its own book, and certainly outside the scope of
                    this one). But publishing a release compatibility policy, and
                    adhering to it, is an inescapable part of distributing software. One
                    nasty surprise can alienate a lot of users. The policy just described
                    is good partly because it's already quite widespread, but also because
                    it's easy to explain and to remember, even for those not already familiar
                    with it.</p>

                <p>It is generally understood that these rules do not apply to
                    pre-1.0 releases (although your release policy should probably state
                    so explicitly, just to be clear). A project that is still in initial
                    development can release 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and so on in sequence, until
                    it's ready for 1.0, and the differences between those releases can be
                    arbitrarily large. Micro numbers in pre-1.0 releases are optional.
                    Depending on the nature of your project and the differences between
                    the releases, you might find it useful to have 0.1.0, 0.1.1, etc., or
                    you might not. Conventions for pre-1.0 release numbers are fairly
                    loose, mainly because people understand that strong compatibility
                    constraints would hamper early development too much, and because early
                    adopters tend to be forgiving anyway.</p>

                <p>Remember that all these injunctions only apply to this
                    particular three-component system. Your project could easily come up
                    with a different three-component system, or even decide it doesn't
                    need such fine granularity and use a two-component system instead.
                    The important thing is to decide early, publish exactly what the
                    components mean, and stick to it.</p></div>

                <p>Some projects use the parity of the minor number component to
                    indicate the stability of the software: even means stable, odd means
                    unstable. This applies only to the minor number, not the major or
                    micro numbers. Increments in the micro number still indicate bug
                    fixes (no new features), and increments in the major number still
                    indicate big changes, new feature sets, etc.</p>

                <p>The advantage of the even/odd system, which has been used by the
                    Linux kernel project among others, is that it offers a way to release
                    new functionality for testing without subjecting production users to
                    potentially unstable code. People can see from the numbers that
                    "2.4.21" is okay to install on their live web server, but that "2.5.1"
                    should probably stay confined to home workstation experiments. The
                    development team handles the bug reports that come in from the
                    unstable (odd-minor-numbered) series, and when things start to settle
                    down after some number of micro releases in that series, they
                    increment the minor number (thus making it even), reset the micro
                    number back to "0", and release a presumably stable package.</p>

                <p>This system preserves, or at least, does not conflict with, the
                    compatibility guidelines given earlier. It simply overloads the minor
                    number with some extra information. This forces the minor number to
                    be incremented about twice as often as would otherwise be necessary,
                    but there's no real harm in that. The even/odd system is probably
                    best for projects that have very long release cycles, and which by
                    their nature have a high proportion of conservative users who value
                    stability above new features. It is not the only way to get new
                    functionality tested in the wild, however. In
                    <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">the section called
                        âStabilizing a Releaseâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span> we will examine another, perhaps more common,
                    method of releasing potentially unstable code to the public, in which
                    the release number is further marked so that people have an idea of
                    the risk/benefit trade-offs immediately on seeing the release's name.</p></div>

            <p>From a developer's point of view, a free software project is in
                a state of continuous release. Developers usually run the latest
                available code at all times, because they want to spot bugs, and
                because they follow the project closely enough to be able to stay away
                from currently unstable areas of the feature space. They often update
                their copy of the software every day, sometimes more than once a day,
                and when they check in a change, they can reasonably expect that every
                other developer will have it within a day or two.</p>

            <p>How, then, should the project make a formal release? Should it
                simply take a snapshot of the tree at a moment in time, package it up,
                and hand it to the world as, say, version "3.5.0"? Common sense says
                no. First, there may be no moment in time when the entire development
                tree is clean and ready for release. Newly-started features could be
                lying around in various states of completion. Someone might have
                checked in a major change to fix a bug, but the change could be
                controversial and under debate at the moment the snapshot is taken.
                If so, it wouldn't work to simply delay the snapshot until the debate
                ends, because another, unrelated debate could start in the meantime,
                and then you'd have wait for <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> one to end too.
                This process is not guaranteed to halt.</p>

            <p>In any case, using full-tree snapshots for releases would
                interfere with ongoing development work, even if the tree could be put
                into a releasable state. Say this snapshot is going to be "3.5.0";
                presumably, the next snapshot would be "3.5.1", and would contain
                mostly fixes for bugs found in the 3.5.0 release. But if both are
                snapshots from the same tree, what are the developers supposed to do
                in the time between the two releases? They can't be adding new
                features; the compatibility guidelines prevent that. But not everyone
                will be enthusiastic about fixing bugs in the 3.5.0 code. Some people
                may have new features they're trying to complete, and will become
                irate if they are forced to choose between sitting idle and working on
                things they're not interested in, just because the project's release
                processes demand that the development tree remain unnaturally
                quiescent.</p>

            <p>The solution to these problems is to always use
                a <em class="firstterm">release branch</em>. A release branch is just a
                branch in the version control system (see
                <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-branch"><em class="firstterm">branch</em></a>), on which the code
                destined for this release can be isolated from mainline development.
                The concept of release branches is certainly not original to free
                software; many proprietary development organizations use them too.
                However, in closed-source environments, release branches are sometimes
                considered a luxuryâa kind of theoretical "best practice" that can,
                in the heat of a major deadline, be dispensed with while everyone on
                the team scrambles to stabilize the main tree.</p>

            <p>Release branches are pretty much required in open source
                projects, however. I have seen projects do releases without them, but
                it has always resulted in some developers sitting idle while
                othersâusually a minorityâwork on getting the release out
                the door. The result is usually bad in several ways. First, overall
                development momentum is slowed. Second, the release is of poorer
                quality than it needed to be, because there were only a few people
                working on it, and they were hurrying to finish so everyone else could
                get back to work. Third, it divides the development team
                psychologically, by setting up a situation in which different types of
                work interfere with each other unnecessarily. The developers sitting
                idle would probably be happy to contribute <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span>
                of their attention to a release branch, as long as that were a choice
                they could make according to their own schedules and interests. But
                without the branch, their choice becomes "Do I participate in the
                project today or not?" instead of "Do I work on the release today, or
                work on that new feature I've been developing in the mainline
                code?"</p>

                <p>The exact mechanics of creating a release branch depend on your
                    version control system, of course, but the general concepts are the
                    same in most systems. A branch usually sprouts from another branch or
                    from the trunk. Traditionally, the trunk is where mainline
                    development goes on, unfettered by release constraints, and, say, the
                    first release branch, the one leading to the "1.0" release, sprouts
                    off the trunk. (The details of how to create and manage branches in
                    your particular version control system are beyond the scope of this
                    book, but the semantics are roughly the same everywhere.) Note that
                    you might want to name the branch "1.0.x" (with a literal "x") instead
                    of "1.0.0". That way you can use the same minor lineâi.e., the
                    same branchâfor all the micro releases in that line.</p>

                <p>The social and technical process of stabilizing the branch for
                    release is covered in <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">the
                        section called âStabilizing a Releaseâ</a><span> later in this chapter</span>. Here we are
                    concerned just with the high-level version control actions that relate
                    tothe release process. When the release branch is stabilized and
                    ready, it is time to tag a snapshot from the branch (see <a class="xref"
                                                                                href="#vc-vocabulary-tag"><em
                            class="firstterm">tag</em>&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>&nbsp;<em
                            class="firstterm">snapshot</em></a><span>in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                                                           title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                        <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) with a name like, e.g.,
                    "1.0.0". The resultant tag represents the exact state of the
                    project's source tree in the 1.0.0 release (this is useful when
                    developers need to compare against an old version while tracking down
                    a bug). The next micro release in the same line is likewise prepared
                    on the 1.0.x branch, and when it is ready, a tag is made for 1.0.1.
                    Lather, rinse, repeat for 1.0.2, and so on. When it's time to start
                    thinking about a 1.1.x release, make a new branch from trunk.</p>

                <p>Maintenance can continue in parallel along both 1.0.x and 1.1.x,
                    and releases can be made independently from both lines (while regular
                    development work happens, as always, on the main
                    trunk&nbsp;â&nbsp;in Git, the "master" branch). In fact, it is
                    not unusual to publish near-simultaneous releases from two different
                    lines. The older series is recommended for more conservative site
                    administrators, who may not want to make the big jump to (say) 1.1
                    without careful preparation. Meanwhile, more adventurous people
                    usually take the most recent release on the highest line, to make sure
                    they're getting the latest features, even at the risk of greater
                    instability.</p></div>
            <p>This is not the only release branch strategy, of course. In
                some circumstances it may not even be the best, though it's worked out
                pretty well for projects I've been involved in. Use any strategy that
                seems to work, but remember the main points: the purpose of a release
                branch is to isolate release work from the fluctuations of daily
                development, and to give the project a physical entityâthe
                release branchâaround which to organize its release process.
                That process is described in detail in the next section.</p></div>

            <p><em class="firstterm">Stabilization</em> is the process of getting a
                release branch into a releasable state; that is, of deciding which
                changes will be in the release, which will not, and shaping the branch
                content accordingly.</p>

            <p>There's a lot of potential grief contained in the word "deciding".
                The last-minute feature rush is a familiar phenomenon in
                collaborative software projects: as soon as developers see that a
                release is about to happen, they scramble to finish their current
                changes, in order not to miss the boat. This, of course, is the exact
                opposite of what you want at release time. It would be much better
                for people to work on features at a comfortable pace, and not worry
                too much about whether their changes make it into this release or the
                next one. The more changes one tries to cram into a release at the
                last minute, the more the code is destabilized, and (usually) the more
                new bugs are created.</p>

            <p>Most software engineers agree in theory on rough criteria for
                what changes should be allowed into a release line during its
                stabilization period. Obviously, fixes for severe bugs can go in,
                especially for bugs without workarounds. Documentation updates are
                fine, as are fixes to error messages (except when they are considered
                part of the interface and must remain stable). Many projects also
                allow certain kinds of low-risk or non-core changes to go in during
                stabilization, and may have formal guidelines for measuring risk. But
                no amount of formalization can obviate the need for human judgement.
                There will always be cases where the project simply has to make a
                decision about whether a given change can go into a release. The
                danger is that since each person wants to see their own favorite
                changes admitted into the release, then there will be plenty of people
                motivated to allow changes, and not enough people motivated to bar
                them.</p>

            <p>Thus, the process of stabilizing a release is mostly about
                creating mechanisms for saying "no". The trick for open source
                projects, in particular, is to come up with ways of saying "no" that
                won't result in too many hurt feelings or disappointed developers, and
                also won't prevent deserving changes from getting into the release.
                There are many different ways to do this. It's pretty easy to design
                systems that satisfy these criteria, once the team has focused on them
                as the important criteria. Here I'll briefly describe two of the most
                popular systems, at the extreme ends of the spectrum, but don't let
                that discourage your project from being creative. Plenty of other
                arrangements are possible; these are just two that I've seen work in
                practice.</p>

                <p>The group agrees to let one person be the <em class="firstterm">release
                    owner</em>. This person has final say over what changes make
                    it into the release. Of course, it is normal and expected for there
                    to be discussions and arguments, but in the end the group must grant
                    the release owner sufficient authority to make final decisions. For
                    this system to work, it is necessary to choose someone with the
                    technical competence to understand all the changes, and the social
                    standing and people skills to navigate the discussions leading up to
                    the release without causing too many hurt feelings.</p>

                <p>A common pattern is for the release owner to say "I don't think
                    there's anything wrong with this change, but we haven't had enough
                    time to test it yet, so it shouldn't go into this release." It helps
                    a lot if the release owner has broad technical knowledge of the
                    project, and can give reasons why the change could be potentially
                    destabilizing (for example, its interactions with other parts of the
                    software, or portability concerns). People will sometimes ask such
                    decisions to be justified, or will argue that a change is not as risky
                    as it looks. These conversations need not be confrontational, as long
                    as the release owner is able to consider all the arguments objectively
                    and not reflexively dig in her heels.</p>

                <p>Note that the release owner need not be the same person as the
                    project leader (in cases where there is a project leader at all; see
                    <a class="xref" href="#benevolent-dictator" title="Benevolent Dictators">the section called
                        âBenevolent Dictatorsâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                        <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>). In fact,
                    sometimes it's
                    good to make sure they're <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the same person.
                    The skills that make a good development leader are not necessarily the
                    same as those that make a good release owner. In something as
                    important as the release process, it may be wise to have someone
                    provide a counterbalance to the project leader's judgement. In that
                    case, the project leader needs to remember that overriding a decision
                    by the release owner will undermine the release owner's authority;
                    that alone may be enough reason, in most situations, to let the
                    release owner win when there is a disagreement.</p>

                <p>Contrast the release owner role with the less dictatorial role
                    described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#release-manager" title="Release manager">the section called âRelease

                <p>At the opposite extreme from dictatorship by release owner,
                    developers can simply vote on which changes to include in the release.
                    However, since the most important function of release stabilization is
                    to <span class="emphasis"><em>exclude</em></span> changes, it's important to design the
                    voting system in such a way that getting a change into the release
                    involves positive action by multiple developers. Including a change
                    should need more than just a simple majority (see <a class="xref" href="#electorate"
                                                                         title="Who Votes?">the section called âWho

<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>). Otherwise,
                    one vote for and none against a given change would suffice to get it
                    into the release, and an
                    unfortunate dynamic would be set up whereby each developer would vote
                    for her own changes, yet would be reluctant to vote against others'
                    changes, for fear of possible retaliation. To avoid this, the system
                    should be arranged such that subgroups of developers must act in
                    cooperation to get any change into the release. This not only means
                    that more people review each change, it also makes any individual
                    developer less hesitant to vote against a change, because she knows
                    that no particular one among those who voted for it would take her
                    vote against as a personal affront. The greater the number of people
                    involved, the more the discussion becomes about the change and less
                    about the individuals.</p>

                <p>The system used for many years in the Subversion project seems
                    to have struck
                    a good balance, so I'll recommend it here. In order for a change to
                    be applied to the release branch, at least three developers must vote
                    in favor of it, and none against. A single "no" vote is enough to
                    stop the change from being included; that is, a "no" vote in a release
                    context is equivalent to a veto (see <a class="xref" href="#veto" title="Vetoes">the section called
                        âVetoesâ</a>).
                    Naturally, any such vote must be accompanied by a justification, and
                    in theory the veto could be overridden if enough people feel it is
                    unreasonable and force a special vote over it. In practice, this
                    never happens. People are
                    conservative around releases anyway, and when someone feels strongly
                    enough to veto the inclusion of a change, there's usually a good
                    reason for it.</p>

                <p>Because the release procedure is deliberately biased toward
                    conservatism, the justifications offered for vetoes are sometimes
                    procedural rather than technical. For example, a person may feel that
                    a change is well-written and unlikely to cause any new bugs, but vote
                    against its inclusion in a micro release simply because it's too
                    bigâperhaps it adds a new feature, or in some subtle way fails
                    to fully follow the compatibility guidelines. I've occasionally even
                    seen developers veto something because they simply had a gut feeling
                    that the change needed more testing, even though they couldn't spot
                    any bugs in it by inspection. People grumbled a little bit, but the
                    vetoes stood and the change was not included in the release (I don't
                    remember if any bugs were found in later testing or not,
                    though).</p>

                    <p>If your project chooses a change voting system, it is imperative
                        that the physical mechanics of setting up ballots and casting votes be
                        as convenient as possible. Although there is plenty of open source
                        electronic voting software available, in practice the easiest thing to
                        do is just to set up a text file in the release branch,
                        called <code class="filename">STATUS</code> or <code class="filename">VOTES</code> or
                        something like that. This file lists each proposed changeâany
                        developer can propose a change for inclusionâalong with all the
                        votes for and against it, plus any notes or comments. (Proposing a
                        change doesn't necessarily mean voting for it, by the way, although
                        the two often go together.) An entry in such a file might look like
                        this:</p><pre class="screen">* commit b31910a7180fc (issue #49)
  Prevent client/server handshake from happening twice.
  Justification:
    Avoids extra network turnaround; small change and easy to review.
  Notes:
    This was discussed in http://.../mailing-lists/message-7777.html
    and other messages in that thread.
  Votes:
    +1: jsmith, kimf
    -1: tmartin (breaks compatibility with some pre-1.0 servers;
                 admittedly, those servers are buggy, but why be
                 incompatible if we don't have to?)
</pre>
                    <p>In this case, the change acquired two positive votes, but was
                        vetoed by tmartin, who gave the reason for the veto in a parenthetical
                        note. The exact format of the entry doesn't matter; whatever your
                        project settles on is fineâperhaps tmartin's explanation for the
                        veto should go up in the "Notes:" section, or perhaps the change
                        description should get a "Description:" header to match the other
                        sections. The important thing is that all the information needed to
                        evaluate the change be easily accessible, and that the mechanism for casting
                        votes be as lightweight as possible. The proposed change is referred
                        to by its revision number in the repository (in the above case a single
                        commit, b31910a7180fc, although a proposed change could just as easily
                        consist of multiple commits). The revision is assumed to refer to a
                        change made on the trunk; if the change were already on the release
                        branch, there would be no need to vote on it. If your version control
                        system doesn't have an obvious syntax for referring to individual
                        changes, then the project should make one up. For voting to be
                        practical, each change under consideration must be unambiguously
                        identifiable.<sup>[<a name="idp8593920" href="#ftn.idp8593920" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>Those proposing or voting for a change are responsible for
                        making sure it applies cleanly to the release branch, that is, applies
                        without conflicts (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-conflict"><em class="firstterm">conflict</em></a>).
                        If there are conflicts, then the entry should either point to an
                        adjusted patch that does apply cleanly, or better yet to a temporary
                        branch that holds an adjusted version of the change, for example:</p><pre class="screen">* r13222, r13223, r13232

    unacceptable performance (&gt;50 minutes for a small commit) in

  Votes:
    +1: epg, ghudson
</pre>
                    <p>That example is taken from real life; it comes from the
                        <code class="filename">STATUS</code> file for the Subversion 1.1.4 release
                        process. Notice how it uses the original revisions as canonical
                        handles on the change, even though there is also a branch with a
                        conflict-adjusted version of the change (the branch also combines the
                        three trunk revisions into one, r13517, to make it easier to merge the
                        change into the release, should it get approval). The original
                        revisions are provided because they're still the easiest entity to
                        review, since they have the original log messages. The temporary
                        branch wouldn't have those log messages; in order to avoid duplication
                        of information (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#vc-singularity" title="Singularity of information">the section called

    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>), the
                        branch's log message for r13517 should simply say "Adjust r13222,
                        r13223, and r13232 for backport to 1.1.x branch." All other
                        information about the changes can be chased down at their original
                        revisions.</p></div>

                    <p>The actual process of merging (see

                                class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>&nbsp;<em class="firstterm">port</em></a>) approved
                        changes into the
                        release branch can be performed by any developer. There does not need
                        to be one person whose job it is to merge changes; if there are a lot
                        of changes, it can be better to spread the burden around.</p>

                    <p>However, although both voting and merging happen in a
                        decentralized fashion, in practice there are usually one or two people
                        driving the release process. This role is sometimes formally blessed
                        as <em class="firstterm">release manager</em>, but it is quite different
                        from a release owner (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#release-owner" title="Dictatorship by Release Owner">the section called
                            âDictatorship by Release Ownerâ</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>) who has
                        final say over the changes. Release managers keep track of how many
                        changes are currently under consideration, how many have been
                        approved, how many seem likely to be approved, etc. If they sense
                        that important changes are not getting enough attention, and might be
                        left out of the release for lack of votes, they will gently nag other
                        developers to review and vote. When a batch of changes are approved,
                        these people will often take it upon themselves to merge them into the
                        release branch; it's fine if others leave that task to them, as
                        long as everyone understands that the release managers are not
                        obligated to do all the
                        work unless they have explicitly committed to it. When the time comes
                        to put the release out the door (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#testing-and-releasing" title="Testing and Releasing">the section called

                        also take care of the logistics of creating the final release
                        packages, collecting digital signatures, uploading the packages, and
                        making the public announcement.</p></div>

            <p>The canonical form for distribution of free software is as
                source code. This is true regardless of whether the software normally
                runs in source form (i.e., can be interpreted, like Perl, Python, PHP,
                etc.) or needs to be compiled first (like C, C++, Java, etc.). With
                compiled software, most users will probably not compile the sources
                themselves, but will instead install from pre-built binary packages
                (see <a class="xref" href="#binary-packages" title="Binary Packages">the section called âBinary
                    Packagesâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>). However, those binary
                packages are still derived from a master source distribution. The
                point of the source package is to unambiguously define the release.
                When the project distributes "Scanley&nbsp;2.5.0", what it means,
                specifically, is "The tree of source code files that, when compiled
                (if necessary) and installed, produces Scanley 2.5.0."</p>

            <p>There is a fairly strict standard for how source releases
                should look. One will occasionally see deviations from this standard,
                but they are the exception, not the rule. Unless there is a compelling
                reason to do otherwise, your project should follow this standard
                too.</p>

                <p>The source code should be shipped in the standard formats for
                    transporting directory trees. For Unix and Unix-like operating
                    systems, the convention is to use TAR format, compressed
                    by <span class="command"><strong>compress</strong></span>, <span
                            class="command"><strong>gzip</strong></span>,

                            class="command"><strong>bzip2</strong></span>. For MS Windows,
                    the standard method for distributing directory trees
                    is <em class="firstterm">zip</em> format, which compresses
                    automatically. For JavaScript projects, it is customary to ship the
                    "minified"<sup>[<a name="idp8622800" href="#ftn.idp8622800" class="footnote">54</a>]</sup>

                    archive type. For example, Scanley 2.5.0, packaged for Unix using GNU
                    Zip (gzip) compression, would look like this:</p>

                <p>Either of these archives, when unpacked, should create a single
                    new directory tree named <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code> in the
                    current directory. Underneath the new directory, the source code
                    should be arranged in a layout ready for compilation (if compilation
                    is needed) and installation. In the top level of new directory tree,
                    there should be a plain text <code class="filename">README</code> file
                    explaining what the software does and what release this is, and giving
                    pointers to other resources, such as the project's web site, other
                    files of interest, etc. Among those other files should be an

                    this release. The <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file accumulates
                    changelists for all releases, in reverse chronological order, so that
                    the list for this release appears at the top of the file. Completing
                    that list is usually the last thing done on a stabilizing release
                    branch; some projects write the list piecemeal as they're developing,
                    others prefer to save it all up for the end and have one person write
                    it, getting information by combing the version control logs. The list
                    looks something like this:</p><pre class="screen">Version 2.5.0
(20 December 2014, from branches 2.5.x)
http://scanley.org/repos/tags/2.5.0/

 New features, enhancements:
    * Added regular expression queries (issue #53)
    * Added support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 documents
    * Documentation translated into Polish, Russian, Malagasy
    * ...

 Bugfixes:
    * fixed reindexing bug (issue #945)
    * fixed some query bugs (issues #815, #1007, #1008)
    * ...
</pre>
                <p>The list can be as long as necessary, but don't bother to
                    include every little bugfix and feature enhancement. Its purpose is
                    to give users an overview of what they would gain by upgrading to
                    the new release, and to tell them about any incompatible changes. In
                    fact, the changelist is customarily included in the announcement email
                    (see <a class="xref" href="#testing-and-releasing" title="Testing and Releasing">the section called
                        âTesting and Releasingâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so write it with that
                    audience in mind.</p>

                <p>The actual layout of the source code inside the tree should be
                    the same as, or as similar as possible to, the source code layout one
                    would get by checking out the project directly from its version
                    control repository. Sometimes there are a few differences, for example
                    because the package contains some generated files needed for
                    configuration and compilation (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#packaging-build-install" title="Compilation and Installation">the section
                        called âCompilation and Installationâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), or because the distribution includes
                    third-party software that is not maintained by the project, but that
                    is required and that users are not likely to already have. But even
                    if the distributed tree corresponds exactly to some development tree
                    in the version control repository, the distribution itself should not
                    be a working copy (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-working-copy"><em class="firstterm">working
                        copy</em>&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>&nbsp;<em class="firstterm">working
                        files</em></a>).
                    The release is supposed to represent a static reference pointâa
                    particular, unchangeable configuration of source files. If it were a
                    working copy, the danger would be that the user might update it, and
                    afterward think that he still has the release when in fact he has
                    something different.</p>

                <p>Remember that the package is the same regardless of the
                    packaging. The releaseâthat is, the precise entity referred to
                    when someone says "Scanley&nbsp;2.5.0"âis the tree created by
                    unpacking a zip file or tarball. So the project might offer all of
                    these for download:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.tar.bz2<br>
                        scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz<br>
                        scanley-2.5.0.zip</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>...but the source tree created by unpacking them would be the
                    same. That source tree itself is the distribution; the form in which it is
                    downloaded is merely a matter of convention or convenience. Certain minor
                    differences between source packages are allowable: for example, in the
                    Windows package, text files may have lines ending with CRLF
                    (Carriage Return and Line Feed), while Unix packages would use just
                    LF. The trees may be arranged slightly differently between source
                    packages destined for different operating systems, too, if those
                    operating systems require different sorts of layouts for compilation.
                    However, these are all basically trivial transformations. The basic
                    source files should be the same across all the packagings of a given
                    release.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="To capitalize or not to capitalize">
                    <div class="titlepage">

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>When referring to a project by name, people generally capitalize
                        it as a proper noun, and capitalize acronyms if there are any:
                        "MySQL&nbsp;5.0", "Scanley&nbsp;2.5.0", etc. Whether this
                        capitalization is reproduced in the package name is up to the project.
                        Either <code class="filename">Scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> or
                        <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> would be fine, for example
                        (I personally prefer the latter, because I don't like to make people
                        hit the shift key, but plenty of projects ship capitalized packages).
                        The important thing is that the directory created by unpacking the
                        tarball use the same capitalization. There should be no surprises:
                        the user must be able to predict with perfect accuracy the name of the
                        directory that will be created when she unpacks a distribution.</p></div>

                <p>For software requiring compilation or installation from source,
                    there are usually standard procedures that experienced users expect to
                    be able to follow. For example, for programs written in C, C++, or
                    certain other compiled languages, the standard under Unix-like systems
                    is for the user to type:</p><pre class="screen">   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install
</pre>
                <p>The first command autodetects as much about the environment as
                    it can and prepares for the build process, the second command builds
                    the software in place (but does not install it), and the last command
                    installs it on the system. The first two commands are done as a
                    regular user, the third as root. For more details about setting up
                    this system, see the excellent <em class="citetitle">GNU Autoconf, Automake, and
                        Libtool</em> book by Vaughan, Elliston, Tromey, and Taylor. It
                    is published as treeware by New Riders, and its content is also freely
                    available online at
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/" target="_top">sources.redhat.com/autobook</a>.
                </p>

                <p>This is not the only standard, though it is one of the most
                    widespread. Other programming languages often have their own
                    standards for building and installing packages. If it's not obvious
                    to you what the applicable standards are for your project, ask an
                    experienced developer; you can safely assume that
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> standard applies, even if you don't know
                    what it is at first.</p>

                <p>Whatever the appropriate standards for you project are, don't
                    deviate from them unless you absolutely must. Standard installation
                    procedures are practically spinal reflexes for a lot of system
                    administrators now. If they see familiar invocations documented in
                    your project's <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file, that instantly
                    raises their faith that your project is generally aware of
                    conventions, and that it is likely to have gotten other things right
                    as well. Also, as discussed in
                    <a class="xref" href="#downloads" title="Downloads">the section called âDownloadsâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>, having a standard
                    build procedure pleases potential developers.</p>

                <p>On Windows, the standards for building and installing are a bit
                    less settled. For projects requiring compilation, the general
                    convention seems to be to ship a tree that can fit into the
                    workspace/project model of the standard Microsoft development
                    environments (Developer Studio, Visual Studio, VS.NET, MSVC++, etc.).
                    Depending on the nature of your software, it may be possible to offer
                    a Unix-like build option on Windows via the Cygwin
                    (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">cygwin.com</a>) environment.
                    And of course,
                    if you're using a language or programming framework that comes with
                    its own build and install conventionsâe.g., Perl or
                    Pythonâyou should simply use whatever the standard method is for
                    that framework, whether on Windows, Unix, Mac OS X, or any other
                    operating system.</p>

                <p>Be willing to put in a lot of extra effort in order to make your
                    project conform to the relevant build or installation standards.
                    Building and installing is an entry point: it's okay for things to get
                    harder after that, if they absolutely must, but it would be a shame
                    for the user's or developer's very first interaction with the software
                    to require unexpected steps.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Binary Packages">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Although the formal release is a source code package, users often
                    install software from binary packages, either provided by their operating
                    system's software distribution mechanism, or obtained manually from
                    the project web site or from some third party. Here "binary" doesn't
                    necessarily mean "compiled"; it's a general term for
                    pre-configured form of
                    the package that allows a user to install it on his computer without
                    going through the usual source-based build and install procedures. On
                    RedHat GNU/Linux, it is the RPM system; on Debian GNU/Linux, it is the
                    APT (<code class="filename">.deb</code>) system; etc.</p>

                <p>Whether these binary packages are assembled by people closely
                    associated with the project, or by distant third parties, users are
                    going to <span class="emphasis"><em>treat</em></span> them as equivalent to the
                    project's official releases, and will file tickets in the project's bug
                    tracker based on the behavior of the binary packages. Therefore, it
                    is in the project's interest to provide packagers with clear
                    guidelines, and work closely with them to see to it that what they
                    produce represents the software fairly and accurately.</p>

                <p>The main thing packagers need to know is that they should always
                    base their binary packages on an official source release. Sometimes
                    packagers are tempted to pull an unstable incarnation of the code from the
                    repository, or to include selected changes that were committed after the
                    release was made, in order to provide users with certain bug fixes or
                    other improvements. The packager thinks he is doing his users a favor
                    by giving them the more recent code, but actually this practice can
                    cause a great deal of confusion. Projects are prepared to receive
                    reports of bugs found in released versions, and bugs found in recent
                    trunk and major branch code (that is, found by people who deliberately
                    run bleeding edge code). When a bug report comes in from these
                    sources, the responder will often be able to confirm immediately that
                    the bug is
                    known to be present in that snapshot, and perhaps that it has since
                    been fixed and that the user should upgrade or wait for the
                    next release. If it is a previously unknown bug, knowing the precise
                    release makes it easier to reproduce and easier to categorize in the
                    tracker.</p>

                <p>Projects are not prepared, however, to receive bug reports based
                    on unspecified intermediate or hybrid versions. Such bugs can be hard
                    to reproduce; also, they may be due to unexpected interactions between
                    isolated changes pulled in from later development, and thereby cause
                    misbehaviors that the project's developers should not have to take the
                    blame for. I have even seen dismayingly large amounts of time wasted
                    because a bug was <span class="emphasis"><em>absent</em></span> when it should have been
                    present: someone was running a slightly patched up version, based on
                    (but not identical to) an official release, and when the predicted bug
                    did not happen, everyone had to dig around a lot to figure out
                    why.</p>

                <p>Still, there will sometimes be circumstances when a packager
                    insists that modifications to the source release are necessary<sup>[<a name="idp8681920"
                                                                                           href="#ftn.idp8681920"

                    Packagers should be encouraged to bring this up with the project's
                    developers and describe their plans. They may get approval, but
                    failing that, they will at least have notified the project of their
                    intentions, so the project can watch out for unusual bug reports. The
                    developers may respond by putting a disclaimer on the project's web
                    site, and may ask that the packager do the same thing in the
                    appropriate place, so that users of that binary package know what they
                    are getting is not exactly the same as what the project officially
                    released. There need be no animosity in such a situation, though
                    unfortunately there often is. It's just that packagers have a
                    slightly different set of goals from developers. The packagers mainly
                    want the best out-of-the-box experience for their users. The
                    developers want that too, of course, but they also need to ensure that
                    they know what versions of the software are out there, so they can
                    receive coherent bug reports and make compatibility guarantees.
                    Sometimes these goals conflict. When they do, it's good to keep in
                    mind that the project has no control over the packagers, and that the
                    bonds of obligation run both ways. It's true that the project is
                    doing the packagers a favor simply by producing the software. But the
                    packagers are also doing the project a favor, by taking on a mostly
                    unglamorous job in order to make the software more widely available,
                    often by orders of magnitude. It's fine to disagree with packagers,
                    but don't flame them; just try to work things out as best you
                    can.</p></div>

            <p>Once the source distribution is produced from the stabilized release
                branch, the public part of the release process begins. But before the
                distribution is made available to the world at large, it should be tested
                and approved by some minimum number of developers, usually three or
                more. Approval is not simply a matter of inspecting the release for
                obvious flaws; ideally, the developers download the package, build and
                install it onto a clean system, run the regression test suite (see
                <a class="xref" href="#automated-testing" title="Automated testing">the section called âAutomated
                    testingâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>), and do some
                manual testing. Assuming it passes these checks, as well as any other
                release checklist criteria the project may have, the developers then
                digitally sign each container (the .tar.gz file, .zip file, etc) using
                GnuPG (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnupg.org/" target="_top">gnupg.org</a>), PGP
                (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pgpi.org/" target="_top">pgpi.org</a>), or some other
                program capable of producing PGP-compatible signatures.</p>

            <p>In most projects, the developers just use their personal digital
                signatures, instead of a shared project key, and as many developers as
                want to may sign (i.e., there is a minimum number, but not a maximum).
                The more developers sign, the more testing the release undergoes, and
                also the greater the likelihood that a security-conscious user can
                find a digital trust path from herself to the release.</p>

            <p>Once approved, the release (that is, all tarballs, zip files,
                and whatever other formats are being distributed) should be placed
                into the project's download area, accompanied by the digital
                signatures, and by MD5/SHA1 checksums (see <a class="ulink"
                                                              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"

                There are various standards for doing this. One way is to accompany
                each released package with a file giving the corresponding digital
                signatures, and another file giving the checksum. For example, if one
                of the released packages is <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code>,
                place in the same directory a file
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.asc</code> containing the digital
                signature for that tarball, another file
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.md5</code> containing its MD5
                checksum, and optionally another,
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.sha1</code>, containing the SHA1
                checksum. A different way to provide checking is to collect all the
                signatures for all the released packages into a single file,
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.sigs</code>; the same may be done with the
                checksums.</p>

            <p>It doesn't really matter which way you do it. Just keep to a
                simple scheme, describe it clearly, and be consistent from release to
                release. The purpose of all this signing and checksumming is to give
                users a way to verify that the copy they receive has not been
                maliciously tampered with. Users are about to run this code on their
                computersâif the code has been tampered with, an attacker could
                suddenly have a back door to all their data. See
                <a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called âSecurity
                    Releasesâ</a><span>

                </div>
                <p>For important releases containing many changes, many projects
                    prefer to put out <em class="firstterm">release candidates</em> first,
                    e.g., <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta1</code> before
                    <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code>. The purpose of a candidate is to
                    subject the code to wide testing before blessing it as an official
                    release. If problems are found, they are fixed on the release branch
                    and a new candidate release is rolled out
                    (<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta2</code>). The cycle continues until
                    no unacceptable bugs are left, at which point the last candidate
                    release becomes the official releaseâthat is, the only
                    difference between the last candidate release and the real release
                    is the removal of the qualifier from the version number.</p>

                <p>In most other respects, a candidate release should be treated
                    the same as a real release. The <span class="emphasis"><em>alpha</em></span>,
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>beta</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>rc</em></span> qualifier
                    is
                    enough to warn conservative users to wait until the real release, and
                    of course the announcement emails for the candidate releases should
                    point out that their purpose is to solicit feedback. Other than
                    that, give candidate releases the same amount of care as regular
                    releases. After all, you want people to use the candidates, because
                    exposure is the best way to uncover bugs, and also because you never
                    know which candidate release will end up becoming the official
                    release.</p></div>

                <p>Announcing a release is like announcing any other event, and
                    should use the procedures described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#publicity" title="Publicity">the section called âPublicityâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>.
                    There are a few
                    specific things to do for releases, though.</p>

                <p>Whenever you write the URL to the downloadable release tarball,
                    make sure to also write the MD5/SHA1 checksums and pointers to the
                    digital signatures file. Since the announcement happens in multiple
                    forums (mailing list, news page, etc.), this means users can get the
                    checksums from multiple sources, which gives the most
                    security-conscious among them extra assurance that the checksums
                    themselves have not been tampered with. Meanwhile, giving the link to the
                    digital signature files multiple times doesn't make those signatures
                    more secure, but it does reassure people (especially those who don't
                    follow the project closely) that the project takes security
                    seriously.</p>

                <p>In the announcement email, and on news pages that contain more
                    than just a blurb about the release, make sure to include the relevant
                    portion of the CHANGES file, so people can see why it might be in
                    their interests to upgrade. This is as important with candidate
                    releases as with final releases; the presence of bugfixes and new
                    features is important in tempting people to try out a candidate
                    release.</p>

                <p>Finally, don't forget to thank the development team, the
                    testers, and all the people who took the time to file good bug
                    reports. Don't single out anyone by name, though, unless there's
                    someone who is individually responsible for a huge piece of work,
                    the value of which is widely recognized by everyone in the
                    project. Be wary of sliding down the slippery slope of credit
                    inflation (see <a class="xref" href="#credit" title="Credit">the section called âCreditâ</a><span>

                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="release-lines"></a>Maintaining Multiple Release

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Most mature projects maintain multiple release lines in
                parallel. For example, after 1.0.0 comes out, that line should
                continue with micro (bugfix) releases 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc., until the
                project explicitly decides to end the line. Note that merely
                releasing 1.1.0 is not sufficient reason to end the 1.0.x line. For
                example, some users make it a policy never to upgrade to the first
                release in a new minor or major seriesâthey let others shake the
                bugs out of, say 1.1.0, and wait until 1.1.1. This isn't necessarily
                selfish (remember, they're forgoing the bugfixes and new features
                too); it's just that, for whatever reason, they've decided to be very
                careful with upgrades. Accordingly, if the project learns of a major
                bug in 1.0.3 right before it's about to release 1.1.0, it would be a
                bit severe to just put the bugfix in 1.1.0 and tell all the old 1.0.x
                users they should upgrade. Why not release both 1.1.0 and 1.0.4, so
                everyone can be happy?</p>

            <p>After the 1.1.x line is well under way, you can declare 1.0.x to
                be at <em class="firstterm">end of life</em>. This should be announced
                officially. The announcement could stand alone, or it could be
                mentioned as part of a 1.1.x release announcement; however you do
                it, users need to know that the old line is being phased out, so they
                can make upgrade decisions accordingly.</p>

            <p>Some projects set a window of time during which they pledge to
                support the previous release line. In an open source context,
                "support" means accepting bug reports against that line, and making
                maintenance releases when significant bugs are found. Other projects
                don't give a definite amount of time, but watch incoming bug reports
                to gauge how many people are still using the older line. When the
                percentage drops below a certain point, they declare end of life for
                the line and stop supporting it.</p>

            <p>For each release, make sure to have a <em class="firstterm">target
                version</em> or <em class="firstterm">target milestone</em>
                available in the bug tracker, so people filing bugs will be able to do
                so against the proper release. Don't forget to also have a target
                called "development" or "latest" for the most recent development
                sources, since some peopleânot only active developersâwill
                often stay ahead of the official releases.</p>

                <p>Most of the details of handling security bugs were covered in
                    <a class="xref" href="#security" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">the section called
                        âAnnouncing Security Vulnerabilitiesâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>,
                    but there are some
                    special details to discuss for doing security releases.</p>

                <p>A <em class="firstterm">security release</em> is a release made
                    solely to close a security vulnerability. The code that fixes the bug
                    cannot be made public until the release is available, which means not
                    only that the fixes cannot be committed to the repository until the
                    day of the release, but also that the release cannot be publicly
                    tested before it goes out the door. Obviously, the developers can
                    examine the fix among themselves, and test the release privately, but
                    widespread real-world testing is not possible.</p>

                <p>Because of this lack of testing, a security release should
                    always consist of some existing release plus the fixes for the
                    security bug, with <span class="emphasis"><em>no other changes</em></span>. This is
                    because the more changes you ship without testing, the more likely
                    that one of them will cause a new bug, perhaps even a new security
                    bug! This conservatism is also friendly to administrators who may
                    need to deploy the security fix, but whose upgrade policy stipulates
                    that they not deploy any other changes at the same time.</p>

                <p>Making a security release sometimes involves some minor
                    deception. For example, the project may have been working on a 1.1.3
                    release, with certain bug fixes to 1.1.2 already publicly declared,
                    when a security report comes in. Naturally, the developers cannot
                    talk about the security problem until they make the fix available;
                    until then, they must continue to talk publicly as though 1.1.3 will
                    be what it's always been planned to be. But when 1.1.3 actually
                    comes out, it will differ from 1.1.2 only in the security fixes, and
                    all those other fixes will have been deferred to 1.1.4 (which, of
                    course, will now <span class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> contain the security
                    fix, as will all other future releases).</p>

                <p>You could add an extra component to an existing release to
                    indicate that it contains security changes only. For example, people
                    would be able to tell just from the numbers that 1.1.2.1 is a security
                    release against 1.1.2, and they would know that any release "higher"
                    than that (e.g., 1.1.3, 1.2.0, etc.) contains the same security fixes.
                    For those in the know, this system conveys a lot of information. On
                    the other hand, for those not following the project closely, it can be
                    a bit confusing to see a three-component release number most of the
                    time with an occasional four-component one thrown in seemingly at
                    random. Most projects I've looked at choose consistency and simply

            <p>Maintaining parallel releases simultaneously has implications
                for how daily development is done. In particular, it makes
                practically mandatory a discipline that would be recommended anyway:
                have each commit be a single logical change, and don't mix unrelated
                changes in the same commit. If a change is too big or too disruptive
                to do in one commit, break it across N commits, where each commit is a
                well-partitioned subset of the overall change, and includes nothing
                unrelated to the overall change.</p>

            <p>Here's an example of an ill-thought-out commit:</p><pre class="screen">commit 3b1917a01f8c50e25db0b71edce32357d2645759
Author: J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;
Date:   Sat 2014-06-28 15:53:07 -0500

Fix Issue #1729: warn on change during re-indexing.

Make indexing gracefully warn the user when a file is changing as it
is being indexed.

* ui/repl.py
  (ChangingFile): New exception class.
  (DoIndex): Handle new exception.

* indexer/index.py
  (FollowStream): Raise new exception if file changes during indexing.
  (BuildDir): Unrelatedly, remove some obsolete comments, reformat
  some code, and fix the error check when creating a directory.

Other unrelated cleanups:

* www/index.html: Fix some typos, set next release date.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
            <p>The problem with it becomes apparent as soon as someone needs to
                port the <code class="function">BuildDir</code> error check fix over to a
                branch for an upcoming maintenance release. The porter doesn't want
                any of the other changesâfor example, perhaps the fix for ticket
                #1729 wasn't approved for the maintenance branch at all, and the
                <code class="filename">index.html</code> tweaks would simply be irrelevant
                there. But she cannot easily grab just the
                <code class="function">BuildDir</code> change via the version control tool's
                merge functionality, because the version control system was told that
                that change is logically grouped with all these other unrelated
                things. In fact, the problem would become apparent even before the
                merge. Merely listing the change for voting would become problematic:
                instead of just giving the revision number, the proposer would have to
                make a special patch or change branch just to isolate the portion of
                the commit being proposed. That would be a lot of work for others to
                suffer through, and all because the original committer couldn't be
                bothered to break things into logical groups.</p>

            <p>In fact, that commit really should have been
                <span class="emphasis"><em>four</em></span> separate commits: one to fix issue
                #1729, another to remove obsolete comments and reformat code in
                <code class="function">BuildDir</code>, another to fix the error check in
                <code class="function">BuildDir</code>, and finally, one to tweak
                <code class="filename">index.html</code>. The third of those commits would be
                the one proposed for the maintenance release branch.</p>

            <p>Of course, release stabilization is not the only reason why
                having each commit be one logical change is desirable.
                Psychologically, a semantically unified commit is easier to review,
                and easier to revert if necessary (in some version control systems,
                reversion is really a special kind of merge anyway). A little
                up-front discipline on each developer's part can save the project a
                lot of headache later.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Planning Releases">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="planning"></a>Planning Releases</h3></div>

                <p>One area where open source projects have historically differed
                    from proprietary projects is in release planning. Proprietary
                    projects usually have firmer deadlines. Sometimes it's because
                    customers were promised that an upgrade would be available by a
                    certain date, because the new release needs to be coordinated with
                    some other effort for marketing purposes, or because the venture
                    capitalists who invested in the whole thing need to see some results
                    before they put in any more funding. Free software projects, on the
                    other hand, are concerned with maintaining a cooperative working
                    atmosphere among many parties, some of them possibly business
                    competitors, and the preservation of the working relationship can
                    trump and single party's deadlines.</p>

                <p>Of course, many open source projects are funded by corporations,
                    and are correspondingly by deadline-conscious management. This is in
                    many ways a good thing, but it can
                    cause conflicts between the priorities of those developers who are
                    being paid and those who are volunteering their time. These conflicts
                    often happen around the issue of when and how to schedule releases.
                    The salaried developers who are under pressure will naturally want to
                    just pick a date when the releases will occur, and have everyone's
                    activities fall into line. But the volunteers may have other
                    agendasâperhaps features they want to complete, or some testing
                    they want to have doneâthat they feel the release should wait
                    on.</p>

                <p>There is no general solution to this problem except discussion
                    and compromise, of course. But you can minimize the frequency and
                    degree of friction caused, by decoupling the proposed
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a given release from the date when
                    it would go out the door. That is, try to steer discussion toward the
                    subject of which releases the project will be making in the near- to
                    medium-term future, and what features will be in them, without at
                    first mentioning anything about dates, except for rough guesses with
                    wide margins of error<sup>[<a name="idp8748064" href="#ftn.idp8748064"
                                                  class="footnote">57</a>]</sup>.
                    By nailing down feature sets early, you reduce
                    the complexity of the discussion centered on any individual release,
                    and therefore improve predictability. This also creates a kind of
                    inertial bias against anyone who proposes to expand the definition of
                    a release by adding new features or other complications. If the
                    release's contents are fairly well defined, the onus is on the
                    proposer to justify the expansion, even though the date of the release
                    may not have been set yet.</p>

                <p>In his multi-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
                    <em class="citetitle">Jefferson and His Time</em>, Dumas Malone tells the
                    story of how Jefferson handled the first meeting held to decide the
                    organization of the future University of Virginia. The University had
                    been Jefferson's idea in the first place, but (as is the case
                    everywhere, not just in open source projects) many other parties had
                    climbed on board quickly, each with their own interests and agendas.
                    When they gathered at that first meeting to hash things out, Jefferson
                    made sure to show up with meticulously prepared architectural
                    drawings, detailed budgets for construction and operation, a proposed
                    curriculum, and the names of specific faculty he wanted to import from
                    Europe. No one else in the room was even remotely as prepared; the
                    group essentially had to capitulate to Jefferson's vision, and the
                    University was eventually founded more or less in accordance with his
                    plans. The facts that construction went far over budget, and that
                    many of his ideas did not, for various reasons, work out in the end,
                    were all things Jefferson probably knew perfectly well would happen.
                    His purpose was strategic: to show up at the meeting with something so
                    substantive that everyone else would have to fall into the role of
                    simply proposing modifications to it, so that the overall shape, and
                    therefore schedule, of the project would be roughly as he
                    wanted.</p>

                <p>In the case of a free software project, there is no single
                    "meeting", but instead a series of small proposals made in the
                    discussion forums and in the ticket tracker. But if you have some
                    credibility in the
                    project to start with, and you start assigning various features,
                    enhancements, and bugs to target releases in the tracker,
                    according to some announced overall plan, people will mostly go along
                    with you. Once you've got things laid out more or less as you want
                    them, the conversations about actual release
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>dates</em></span> will go much more smoothly.</p>

                <p>It is crucial, of course, to never present any individual
                    decision as written in stone. In the comments associated with each
                    assignment of a ticket to a specific future release, invite
                    discussion, dissent, and be genuinely willing to be persuaded whenever
                    possible. Never exercise control merely for the sake of exercising
                    control: the more deeply others feel they can participate in the
                    release planning process (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#share-management" title="Share Management Tasks as Well as Technical Tasks">the
                        section called âShare Management Tasks as Well as Technical Tasksâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>), the easier it
                    will be to persuade them to share your priorities on the issues that
                    really count for you.</p>

                <p>The other way the project can lower tensions around release
                    planning is to make releases fairly often. When there's a long time
                    between releases, the importance of any individual release is
                    magnified in everyone's minds; people are that much more crushed when
                    their code doesn't make it in, because they know how long it might be
                    until the next chance. Depending on the complexity of the release
                    process and the nature of your project, somewhere between every three
                    and six months is usually about the right gap between releases, though
                    maintenance lines may put out micro releases a bit faster, if there is
                    demand for them.</p></div>

            <p>Getting people to agree on what a project needs, and to work
                together to achieve it, requires more than just a genial atmosphere
                and a lack of obvious dysfunction. It requires someone, or several
                someones, consciously managing all the people involved. Managing
                volunteers may not be a technical craft in the same sense as computer
                programming, but it is a craft in the sense that it can be improved
                through study and practice.</p>

            <p>This chapter is a grab-bag of specific techniques for managing
                volunteers. It draws, perhaps more heavily than previous chapters, on
                the Subversion project as a case study, partly because I was working
                on that project as I wrote the first edition of this book and had all
                the primary sources close
                at hand, and partly because it's more acceptable to cast critical
                stones into one's own glass house than into others'. But I have also
                seen in various other projects the benefits of applyingâand the
                consequences of not applyingâthe recommendations that follow;
                when it is politically feasible to give examples from some of those
                other projects, I will do so.</p>

            <p>Speaking of politics, this is as good a time as any to drag that
                much-maligned word out for a closer look. Many engineers like to
                think of politics as something other people engage in.
                "<span class="emphasis"><em>I'm</em></span> just advocating the best course for the
                project, but <span class="emphasis"><em>he's</em></span> raising objections for
                political reasons." I believe this distaste for politics (or for what
                is imagined to be politics) is especially strong in engineers because
                engineers are bought into the idea that some solutions are objectively
                superior to others. Thus, when someone acts in a way that seems
                motivated by outside considerationsâsay, the maintenance of his
                own position of influence, the lessening of someone else's
                influence, outright horse-trading, or avoiding hurting someone's
                feelingsâother participants in the project may get annoyed. Of
                course, this rarely prevents them from behaving in the same way when
                their own vital interests are at stake.</p>

            <p>If you consider "politics" a dirty word, and hope to keep your
                project free of it, give up right now. Politics are inevitable
                whenever people have to cooperatively manage a shared resource. In
                the case of an open source project, even though the code itself is not
                a shared resource (since it can be copied by anyone), attention,
                credibility, and influence in the project are very much shared
                resources: they are by definition not copyable, not forkable.</p>

            <p>Thus it is quite reasonable that one of the considerations
                going into each person's decision-making process is the question of
                how a given action might affect his own future influence in the
                project. After all, if you trust your own judgement and skills, as
                most programmers do, then the potential loss of future influence has
                to be considered a technical result, in a sense. Similar reasoning
                applies to other behaviors that might seem, on their face, like "pure"
                politics. In fact, there is no such thing as pure politics: it is
                precisely because actions have multiple real-world consequences that
                people become politically conscious in the first place. Politics is,
                in the end, simply an acknowledgment that <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
                consequences of decisions must be taken into account. If a particular
                decision leads to a result that most participants find technically
                satisfying, but involves a change in power relationships that leaves
                key people feeling isolated, the latter is just as important a result
                as the former. To ignore it would not be high-minded, but
                shortsighted.</p>

            <p>So as you read the advice that follows, and as you work with
                your own project, remember that there is <span class="emphasis"><em>no one</em></span>
                who is above politics. Appearing to be above politics is merely one
                particular political strategy, and sometimes a very useful one, but it
                is never the reality. Politics is simply what happens when people
                disagree on the use or allocation of a shared asset, and successful
                projects are those that evolve political mechanisms for managing such
                disagreement constructively.</p></div>

                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="volunteers"></a>Getting the Most Out of
                        Volunteers</h2></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Why do volunteers work on free software
                projects?<sup>[<a name="idp9031680" href="#ftn.idp9031680" class="footnote">58</a>]</sup></p>

            <p>When asked, many claim they do it because they want to produce
                good software, or want to be personally involved in fixing the bugs
                that matter to them. But these reasons are usually not the whole
                story. After all, could you imagine a volunteer staying with a
                project even if no one ever said a word in appreciation of her work,
                or listened to her in discussions? Of course not. Clearly, people
                spend time on free software for reasons beyond just an abstract desire
                to produce good code. Understanding volunteers' true motivations will
                help you arrange things so as to attract and keep them. The desire to
                produce good software may be among those motivations, along with the
                challenge and educational value of working on hard problems. But
                humans also have a built-in desire to work with other humans, and to
                give and earn respect through cooperative activities. Groups engaged
                in cooperative activities must evolve norms of behavior such that
                status is acquired and kept through actions that help the group's
                goals.</p>

            <p>Those norms won't always arise by themselves. For example, on
                some projectsâexperienced open source developers can probably
                name several off the tops of their headsâpeople apparently feel
                that status is acquired by posting frequently and verbosely. They
                don't come to this conclusion accidentally; they come to it because
                they are rewarded with respect for making long, intricate arguments,
                whether or not that actually helps the project. Following are some
                techniques for creating an atmosphere in which status-acquiring
                actions are also <span class="emphasis"><em>constructive</em></span> actions.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Delegation">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="delegation"></a>Delegation</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Delegation is not merely a way to spread the workload around; it
                    is also a political and social tool. Consider all the effects when
                    you ask someone to do something. The most obvious effect is that, if
                    he accepts, he does the task and you don't. But another effect is
                    that he is made aware that you trusted him to handle the task.
                    Furthermore, if you made the request in a public forum, then he knows
                    that others in the group have been made aware of that trust too. He
                    may also feel some pressure to accept, which means you must ask in a
                    way that allows him to decline gracefully if he doesn't really want
                    the job. If the task requires coordination with others in the
                    project, you are effectively proposing that he become more involved,
                    form bonds that might not otherwise have been formed, and perhaps
                    become a source of authority in some subdomain of the project. The
                    added involvement may be daunting, or it may lead him to become
                    engaged in other ways as well, from an increased feeling of overall
                    commitment.</p>

                <p>Because of all these effects, it often makes sense to ask
                    someone else to do something even when you know you could do it faster
                    or better yourself. Of course, there is sometimes a strict economic
                    efficiency argument for this anyway: perhaps the opportunity cost of
                    doing it yourself would be too highâthere might be something
                    even more important you could do with that time. But even when that
                    kind of comparative advantage argument doesn't apply, you may
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> want to ask someone else to take on the
                    task, because in the long run you want to draw that person deeper into
                    the project, even if it means spending extra time watching over them
                    at first. The converse technique also applies: if you occasionally
                    volunteer for work that someone else doesn't want or have time to do,
                    you will gain her good will and respect. Delegation and
                    substitution are not just about getting individual tasks done; they're
                    also about drawing people into a closer committment to the
                    project.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Distinguish clearly between inquiry and assignment">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="delegation-assignment"></a>Distinguish clearly between

                    </div>
                    <p>Sometimes it is fair to expect that a person will accept a
                        particular task. For example, if someone writes a bug into the code,
                        or commits code that fails to comply with project guidelines in some
                        obvious way, then it is enough to point out the problem and thereafter
                        behave as though you assume the person will take care of it. Also, if
                        they have stated publicly that they will do something, it is
                        reasonable to depend on that. But there are other situations where it
                        is by no means clear that you have a right to expect action. The
                        person may do as you ask, or may not. Since no one likes to be taken
                        for granted, you need to be sensitive to the difference between these
                        two types of situations, and tailor your requests accordingly.</p>

                    <p>One thing that almost always causes people instant annoyance is
                        being asked to do something in a way that implies that you think it is
                        clearly their responsibility to do it, when they feel otherwise. For
                        example, assignment of incoming tickets is particularly fertile ground
                        for this kind of annoyance. The participants in a project usually
                        know who is expert in what areas, so when a bug report comes in, there
                        will often be one or two people whom everyone knows could probably fix
                        it quickly. However, if you assign the ticket over to one of those
                        people without her prior permission, she may feel she has been
                        put into an uncomfortable position. She senses the pressure of
                        expectation, but also may feel that she is, in effect, being
                        punished for her expertise. After all, the way one acquires
                        expertise is by fixing bugs, so perhaps someone else should take this
                        one! (Note that ticket trackers that automatically assign tickets to
                        particular people based on information in the bug report are less
                        likely to offend, because everyone knows that the assignment was made
                        by an automated process, and is not an indication of human
                        expectations.)</p>

                    <p>While it would be nice to spread the load as evenly as possible,
                        there are certain times when you just want to encourage the person who
                        can fix a bug the fastest to do so. Given that you can't afford a
                        communications turnaround for every such assignment ("Would you be
                        willing to look at this bug?" "Yes." "Okay, I'm assigning the ticket
                        over to you then." "Okay."), you should simply make the assignment in
                        the form of an inquiry, conveying no pressure. Virtually all ticket
                        trackers allow a comment to be associated with the assignment of an
                        ticket. In that comment, you can say something like this:</p>

                    <div class="blockquote">
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Assigning this over to you, jrandom, because you're most
                            familiar with this code. Feel free to bounce this back if you
                            don't have time to look at it, though. (And let me know if you'd
                            prefer not to receive such requests in the future.)</p></blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>This distinguishes clearly between the
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>request</em></span> for assignment and the
                        recipient's <span class="emphasis"><em>acceptance</em></span> of that assignment. The
                        audience here isn't only the assignee, it's everyone: the entire group
                        sees a public confirmation of the assignee's expertise, but the
                        message also makes it clear that the assignee is free to accept or
                        decline the responsibility.</p></div>

                        someone else is appreciating their work). If there is no response
                        after a few days, ask again, or post saying that you got no
                        response and are looking for someone else to do it. Or just do it
                        yourself, but still make sure to say that you got no response to the
                        initial inquiry.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of publicly noting the lack of response is
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to humiliate the person, and your remarks
                        should be phrased so as not to have that effect. The purpose is
                        simply to show that you keep track of what you have asked for, and
                        that you notice the reactions you get. This makes people more likely
                        to say yes next time, because they will observe (even if only
                        unconsciously) that you are likely to notice any work they do, given
                        that you noticed the much less visible event of someone failing to
                        respond.</p></div>

                        noticedâin general, the more aspects of someone's personality
                        you notice and remember, the more comfortable he will be, and the
                        more he will want to work with groups of which you are a
                        part.</p>

                    <p>For example, there was a sharp distinction in the Subversion
                        project between people who wanted to reach a definitive 1.0 release
                        (which we eventually did), and people who mainly wanted to add new
                        features and work on interesting problems but who didn't much care
                        when 1.0 came out. Neither of these positions is better or worse than
                        the other; they're just two different kinds of developers, and both
                        kinds do lots of work on the project. But we swiftly learned that it
                        was important to <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> assume that the excitement
                        of the 1.0 drive was shared by everyone. Electronic media can be very
                        deceptive: you may sense an atmosphere of shared purpose when, in fact,
                        it's shared only by the people you happen to have been talking to,
                        while others have completely different priorities.</p>

                    <p>The more aware you are of what different people want out of the project,
                        the more effectively you can make requests of them. Even just
                        demonstrating an understanding of what they want, without making any
                        associated request, is useful, in that it confirms to each person that
                        she's not just another particle in an undifferentiated mass.</p></div>

            <div class="sect2" title="Praise and Criticism">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="praise-and-criticism"></a>Praise and Criticism</h3></div>

                </div>
                <p>Praise and criticism are not opposites; in many ways, they are
                    very similar. Both are primarily forms of attention, and are most
                    effective when specific rather than generic. Both should be deployed
                    with concrete goals in mind. Both can be diluted by inflation: praise
                    too much or too often and you will devalue your praise; the same is
                    true for criticism, though in practice, criticism is usually reactive
                    and therefore a bit more resistant to devaluation.</p>

                <p>An important feature of technical culture is that detailed,
                    dispassionate criticism is often taken as a kind of praise (as
                    discussed in <a class="xref" href="#rudeness" title="Recognizing Rudeness">the section called
                        âRecognizing Rudenessâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6,
                        <i>Communications</i></a></span>), because of the
                    implication that the recipient's work is worth the time required to
                    analyze it. However, both of those
                    conditionsâ<span class="emphasis"><em>detailed</em></span> and
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>dispassionate</em></span>âmust be met for this to be
                    true. For example, if someone makes a sloppy change to the code, it
                    is useless (and actually harmful) to follow up saying simply "That was
                    sloppy." Sloppiness is ultimately a characteristic of a
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>person</em></span>, not of their work, and it's important to
                    keep your reactions focused on the work. It's much more effective to
                    describe all the things wrong with the change, tactfully and without
                    malice. If this is the third or fourth careless change in a row by
                    the same person, it's appropriate to say thatâagain without
                    angerâat the end of your critique, to make it clear that the
                    pattern has been noticed.</p>

                <p>If someone does not improve in response to criticism, the
                    solution is not more or stronger criticism. The solution is for the
                    group to remove that person from the position of incompetence, in a
                    way that minimizes hurt feelings as much as possible; see
                    <a class="xref" href="#transitions" title="Transitions">the section called âTransitionsâ</a><span> later in
this chapter</span> for examples. That is a rare
                    occurrence, however. Most people respond pretty well to criticism
                    that is specific, detailed, and contains a clear (even if unspoken)
                    expectation of improvement.</p>

                <p>Praise won't hurt anyone's feelings, of course, but that doesn't
                    mean it should be used any less carefully than criticism. Praise is a
                    tool: before you use it, ask yourself <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you
                    want to use it. As a rule, it's not a good idea to regularly praise people for
                    doing what they usually do, or for actions that are a normal and
                    expected part of participating in the group. If you were to do that,
                    it would be hard to know when to stop: should you praise
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> for doing the usual things? After all,
                    if you leave some people out, they'll wonder why. It's much better to
                    express praise and gratitude sparingly, in response to unusual or
                    unexpected efforts, with the intention of encouraging more such
                    efforts. When a participant seems to have moved permanently into a
                    state of higher productivity, adjust your praise threshold for that
                    person accordingly. Repeated praise for normal behavior gradually
                    becomes meaningless anyway. Instead, that person should sense that
                    her high level of productivity is now considered normal and natural,
                    and only work that goes beyond that should be specially noticed.</p>

                <p>This is not to say that the person's contributions shouldn't be
                    acknowledged, of course. But remember that if the project is set up
                    right, everything that person does is already visible anyway, and so
                    the group will know (and the person will know that the rest of the
                    group knows) everything she does. There are also ways to acknowledge
                    someone's work by means other than direct praise. You could mention
                    in passing, while discussing a related topic, that she has done a lot
                    of work in the given area and is the resident expert there; you
                    could publicly consult her on some question about the code; or perhaps
                    most effectively, you could conspicuously make further use of the work
                    she has done, so she sees that others are now comfortable relying on
                    the results of her work. It's probably not necessary to do these
                    things in any calculated way. Someone who regularly makes large
                    contributions in a project will know it, and will occupy a position of
                    influence by default. There's usually no need to take explicit steps
                    to ensure this, unless you sense that, for whatever reason, a
                    contributor is underappreciated.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Prevent Territoriality">

                <p>Watch out for participants who try to stake out exclusive
                    ownership of certain areas of the project, and who seem to want to do
                    all the work in those areas, to the extent of aggressively taking over
                    work that others start. Such behavior may even seem healthy at first.
                    After all, on the surface it looks like the person is taking on more
                    responsibility, and showing increased activity within a given area.
                    But in the long run, it is destructive. When people sense a "no
                    trespassing" sign, they stay away. This results in reduced review in
                    that area, and greater fragility, because the lone developer becomes a
                    single point of failure. Worse, it fractures the cooperative,
                    egalitarian spirit of the project. The theory should always be that
                    any developer is welcome to help out on any task at any time. Of
                    course, in practice things work a bit differently: people do have
                    areas where they are more and less influential, and non-experts
                    frequently defer to experts in certain domains of the project. But
                    the key is that this is all voluntary: informal authority is granted
                    based on competence and proven judgement, but it should never be
                    actively
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>taken</em></span>. Even if the person desiring the authority
                    really is competent, it is still crucial that she hold that authority
                    informally, through the consensus of the group, that the exact
                    boundaries of the authority remain fuzzy and subjective, and that the
                    authority never cause her to exclude others from working in that area.</p>

                <p>Rejecting or editing someone's work for technical reasons is an
                    entirely different matter, of course. There, the decisive factor
                    is the content of the work, not who happened to act as gatekeeper. It
                    may be that the same person happens to do most of the reviewing for a
                    given area, but as long as he never tries to prevent someone else from
                    doing that work too, things are probably okay.</p>

                    <p>The wonderful term <em class="firstterm">cookie licking</em>,
                        which I first heard from Sumana Harihareswara, can be used for the
                        situation where someone claims, in front of the group, that they're
                        going to take care of a certain task but then does nothing with it.
                        As Sumana says<sup>[<a name="idp9076352" href="#ftn.idp9076352" class="footnote">59</a>]</sup>:
                        "Nobody in their right mind would pick up and eat the licked cookie
                        or finish the [task]." If you think you see an instance of cookie
                        licking happening in your project, simply pointing it out may be
                        enough to de-territorialize the task in question and make others
                        consider picking it up (may be enough to sterilize the cookie,
                        I guess, though at this point staying with the analogy may be more
                        confusing than helpful).</p></div>
                <p>In order to combat incipient territorialism, or even the
                    appearance of it, many projects have taken the step of banning the
                    inclusion of author names or designated maintainer names in source
                    files. I wholeheartedly agree with this practice: we follow it in the
                    Subversion project, and it is more or less official policy at the
                    Apache Software Foundation. ASF member Sander Striker puts it this
                    way:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>At the Apache Software foundation we
                        discourage the
                        use of author tags in source code. There are various reasons for
                        this, apart from the legal ramifications. Collaborative
                        development is about working on projects as a group and caring for
                        the project as a group. Giving credit is good, and should be done,
                        but in a way that does not allow for false attribution, even by
                        implication. There is no clear line for when to add or remove an
                        author tag. Do you add your name when you change a comment? When
                        you put in a one-line fix? Do you remove other author tags when
                        you refactor the code and it looks 95% different? What do you do
                        about people who go about touching every file, changing just enough
                        to make the virtual author tag quota, so that their name will be
                        everywhere?</em></span></p>

                        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>There are better ways to give credit, and our
                            preference is to use those. From a technical standpoint author
                            tags are unnecessary; if you wish to find out who wrote a
                            particular piece of code, the version control system can be
                            consulted to figure that out. Author tags also tend to get out of
                            date. Do you really wish to be contacted in private about a piece
                            of code you wrote five years ago and were glad to have
                            forgotten?</em></span></p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>A software project's source code files are the core of its
                    identity. They should reflect the fact that the developer community
                    as a whole is responsible for them, and not be divided up into
                    little fiefdoms.</p>

                <p>People sometimes argue in favor of author or maintainer tags in
                    source files on the grounds that this gives visible credit to those
                    who have done the most work there. There are two problems with this
                    argument. First, the tags inevitably raise the awkward question of
                    how much work one must do to get one's own name listed there too.
                    Second, they conflate the issue of credit with that of authority:
                    having done work in the past does not imply ownership of the area
                    where the work was done, but it's difficult if not impossible to avoid
                    such an implication when individual names are listed at the tops of
                    source files. In any case, credit information can already be obtained
                    from the version control logs and other out-of-band mechanisms like
                    mailing list archives, so no information is lost by banning it from
                    the source files themselves.<sup>[<a name="idp8986304" href="#ftn.idp8986304"
                                                         class="footnote">60</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>If your project decides to ban individual names from source
                    files, make sure not to go overboard. For instance, many
                    projects have a <code class="filename">contrib/</code> area where small tools and
                    helper scripts are kept, often written by people who are otherwise not
                    associated with the project. It's fine for those files to contain
                    author names, because they are not really maintained by the project as
                    a whole. On the other hand, if a contributed tool starts getting
                    hacked on by other people in the project, eventually you may want to
                    move it to a less isolated location and, assuming the original author
                    approves, remove the author's name, so that the code looks like any
                    other community-maintained resource. If the author is sensitive about
                    this, compromise solutions are acceptable, for example:</p>

                <p>But it's better to avoid such compromises, if possible, and most
                    authors are willing to be persuaded, because they're happy that their
                    contribution is being made a more integral part of the project.</p>

                <p>The important thing is to remember that there is a continuum
                    between the core and the periphery of any project. The main source
                    code files for the software are clearly part of the core, and should
                    be considered as maintained by the community. On the other hand,
                    companion tools or pieces of documentation may be the work of single
                    individuals, who maintain them essentially alone, even though the
                    works may be associated with, and even distributed with, the project.
                    There is no need to apply a one-size-fits-all rule to every file, as
                    long as the principle that community-maintained resources are not
                    allowed to become individual territories is upheld.</p></div>

                <p>Try not to let humans do what machines could do instead. As a
                    rule of thumb, automating a common task is worth at least ten times the
                    effort a developer would spend doing that task manually one time. For
                    very frequent or very complex tasks, that ratio could easily go up to
                    twenty or even higher.</p>

                <p>Thinking of yourself as a "project manager", rather than just
                    another developer, may be a useful attitude here. Sometimes
                    individual developers are too wrapped up in low-level work to see the
                    big picture and realize that everyone is wasting a lot of effort
                    performing automatable tasks manually. Even those who do realize it
                    may not take the time to solve the problem: because each individual
                    performance of the task does not feel like a huge burden, no one ever
                    gets annoyed enough to do anything about it. What makes automation
                    compelling is that the small burden is multiplied by the number of
                    times each developer incurs it, and then <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>
                    number is multiplied by the number of developers.</p>

                <p>Here, I am using the term "automation" broadly, to mean not only
                    repeated actions where one or two variables change each time, but any
                    sort of technical infrastructure that assists humans. The minimum
                    standard automation required to run a project these days was described
                    in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                          title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i>Technical
                        Infrastructure</i></a>, but each project
                    may have its own special problems too. For example, a group working
                    on documentation might want to have a web site displaying the most
                    up-to-date versions of the documents at all times. Since
                    documentation is often written in a markup language like XML, there
                    may be a compilation step, often quite intricate, involved in creating
                    displayable or downloadable documents. Arranging a web site where
                    such compilation happens automatically on every commit can be
                    complicated and time-consumingâbut it is worth it, even if it
                    costs you a day or more to set up. The overall benefits of having
                    up-to-date pages available at all times are huge, even though the cost
                    of <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> having them might seem like only a small
                    annoyance at any single moment, to any single developer.</p>

                <p>Taking such steps eliminates not merely wasted time, but the
                    griping and frustration that ensue when humans make missteps (as they
                    inevitably will) in trying to perform complicated procedures manually.
                    Multi-step, deterministic operations are exactly what computers were
                    invented for; save your humans for more interesting things.</p>

                    <p>Automated test runs are helpful for any software project, but
                        especially so for open source projects, because automated testing
                        (especially regression testing) allows developers to feel comfortable
                        changing code in areas they are unfamiliar with, and thus encourages
                        exploratory development. Since detecting breakage is so hard to do by
                        handâone essentially has to guess where one might have broken
                        something, and try various experiments to prove that one
                        didn'tâhaving automated ways to detect such breakage saves the
                        project a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of time. It also makes people much
                        more relaxed about refactoring large swaths of code, and therefore
                        contributes to the software's long-term maintainability.</p>

                        <p><em class="firstterm">Regression testing</em> means testing for
                            the reappearance of already-fixed bugs. The purpose of regression
                            testing is to reduce the chances that code changes will break the
                            software in unexpected ways. As a software project gets bigger and
                            more complicated, the chances of such unexpected side effects
                            increase steadily. Good design can reduce the rate at which the
                            chances increase, but it cannot eliminate the problem
                            entirely.</p>

                        <p>As a result, many projects have a <em class="firstterm">test
                            suite</em>, a separate program that invokes the project's
                            software in ways that have been known in the past to stimulate
                            specific bugs. If the test suite succeeds in making one of these
                            bugs happen, this is known as a <em class="firstterm">regression</em>,
                            meaning that someone's change unexpectedly unfixed a
                            previously-fixed bug.</p>

                        </p></div>
                    <p>Regression testing is not a panacea. For one thing, it works
                        best for programs with batch-style interfaces. Software that is
                        operated primarily through graphical user interfaces is much harder to
                        drive programmatically. Another problem is that the regression test
                        suite framework itself can often be quite complex, with a learning
                        curve and maintenance burden all its own. Reducing this complexity is
                        one of the most useful things you can do, even though it may take a
                        considerable amount of time. The easier it is to add new tests to the
                        suite, the more developers will do so, and the fewer bugs will survive
                        to release. Any effort spent making tests easier to write will be
                        paid back manyfold over the lifetime of the project.</p>

                    <p>Many projects have a <em class="firstterm">"Don't break the
                        build!"</em> rule, meaning: don't commit a change that makes
                        the software unable to compile or run. Being the person who broke the
                        build is usually cause for mild embarrassment and ribbing. Projects
                        with regression test suites often have a corollary rule: don't commit
                        any change that causes tests to fail. Such failures are easiest to
                        spot if there are automatic nightly runs of the entire test suite,
                        with the results mailed out to the development list or to a dedicated
                        test-results mailing list; that's another example of a worthwhile
                        automation.</p>

                    <p>Most volunteer developers are willing to take the extra time to
                        write regression tests, when the test system is comprehensible and
                        easy to work with. Accompanying changes with tests is understood to
                        be the responsible thing to do, and it's also an easy opportunity for
                        collaboration: often two developers will divide up the work for a
                        bugfix, with one writing the fix itself, and the other writing the
                        test. The latter developer may often end up with more work, and since
                        writing a test is already less satisfying than actually fixing the
                        bug, it is imperative that the test suite not make the experience more
                        painful than it has to be.</p>

                    <p>Some projects go even further, requiring that a new test
                        accompany <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> bugfix or new feature. Whether
                        this is a good idea or not depends on many factors: the nature of the
                        software, the makeup of the development team, and the difficulty of
                        writing new tests. The CVS (<a class="ulink" href="http://cvs.nongnu.org/" target="_top">cvs.nongnu.org/</a>)
                        project has long had such a rule. It is a good policy in theory,
                        since CVS is version control software and therefore very risk-averse
                        about the possibility of munging or mishandling the user's data. The
                        problem in practice is that CVS's regression test suite is a single
                        huge shell script (amusingly named <code class="filename">sanity.sh</code>),
                        hard to read and hard to modify or extend. The difficulty of adding
                        new tests, combined with the requirement that patches be accompanied
                        by new tests, means that CVS effectively discourages patches. When I
                        used to work on CVS, I sometimes saw people start on and even complete
                        a patch to CVS's own code, but give up when told of the requirement to
                        add a new test to <code class="filename">sanity.sh</code>.</p>

                    <p>It is normal to spend more time writing a new regression test
                        than on fixing the original bug. But CVS carried this phenomenon to
                        an extreme: one might spend hours trying to design one's test
                        properly, and still get it wrong, because there are just too many
                        unpredictable complexities involved in changing a 35,000-line Bourne
                        shell script. Even longtime CVS developers often grumbled when they
                        had to add a new test.</p>

                    <p>This situation was due to a failure on all our parts to consider
                        the automation ratio. It is true that switching to a real test
                        frameworkâwhether custom-built or off-the-shelfâwould have
                        been a major effort.<sup>[<a name="idp9123472" href="#ftn.idp9123472"
                                                     class="footnote">61</a>]</sup> But neglecting to do so has
                        cost the project much more, over the years. How many bugfixes and new
                        features are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> in CVS today, because of the
                        impediment of an awkward test suite? We cannot know the exact number,
                        but it is surely many times greater than the number of bugfixes or new
                        features the developers might forgo in order to develop a new test
                        system (or integrate an off-the-shelf system). That task would only
                        take a finite amount of time, while the penalty of using the current
                        test suite will continue forever if nothing is done.</p>

                    <p>The point is not that having strict requirements to write tests
                        is bad, nor that writing your test system as a Bourne shell script is
                        necessarily bad. It might work fine, depending on how you design it
                        and what it needs to test. The point is simply that when the test
                        system becomes a significant impediment to development, something must
                        be done. The same is true for any routine process that turns into a
                        barrier or a bottleneck.</p></div>

                <p>Each interaction with a user is an opportunity to get a new
                    volunteer. When a user takes the time to post to one of the project's
                    mailing lists, or to file a bug report, she has already tagged herself
                    as having more potential for involvement than most users (from whom
                    the project will never hear at all). Follow up on that potential: if
                    she described a bug, thank her for the report and ask her if he wants
                    to try fixing it. If she wrote to say that an important question was
                    missing from the FAQ, or that the program's documentation was
                    deficient in some way, then freely acknowledge the problem (assuming
                    it really exists) and ask if she's interested in writing the missing
                    material herself. Naturally, much of the time the user will demur.
                    But it doesn't cost much to ask, and every time you do, it reminds the
                    other listeners in that forum that getting involved in the project is
                    something anyone can do.</p>

                <p>Don't limit your goals to acquiring new developers and
                    documentation writers. For example, even training people to write
                    good bug reports pays off in the long run, if you don't spend
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> much time per person, and if they go on
                    to submit more bug reports in the futureâwhich they are more
                    likely to do if they got a constructive reaction to their first
                    report. A constructive reaction need not be a fix for the bug,
                    although that's always the ideal; it can also be a solicitation for
                    more information, or even just a confirmation that the behavior
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a bug. People want to be listened to.
                    Secondarily, they want their bugs fixed. You may not always be able
                    to give them the latter in a timely fashion, but you (or rather, the
                    project as a whole) can give them the former.</p>

                <p>A corollary of this is that developers should not express anger
                    at people who file well-intended but vague bug reports. This is one
                    of my personal pet peeves; I see developers do it all the time on
                    various open source mailing lists, and the harm it does is palpable.
                    Some hapless newbie will post a useless report:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Hi, I can't get Scanley to run. Every time I start it up, it
                        just errors. Is anyone else seeing this problem?</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>Some developerâwho has seen this kind of report a
                    thousand times, and hasn't stopped to think that the newbie has
                    notâwill respond like this:</p>

                        Sheesh. Give us at least some details, like the version of
                        Scanley, your operating system, and the error.</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>This developer has failed to see things from the user's point of
                    view, and also failed to consider the effect such a reaction might
                    have on all the <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> people watching the
                    exchange. Naturally a user who may have no programming experience, and no
                    prior experience reporting bugs, will not know how to write a bug
                    report. What is the right way to handle such a person? Educate them!
                    And do it in such a way that they come back for more:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Sorry you're having trouble. We'll need more information in

                        the error. The very best thing you can do is send a transcript
                        showing the exact commands you ran, and the output they produced.

                </div>
                <p>This way of responding is far more effective at
                    extracting the needed information from the user, because it is written
                    to the user's point of view. First, it expresses sympathy:
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>You had a problem; we feel your pain</em></span>. (This is
                    not necessary in every bug report response; it depends on the severity
                    of the problem and how upset the user seemed.) Second, instead of
                    belittling him for not knowing how to report a bug, it tells him how,
                    and in enough detail to be actually usefulâfor example, many
                    users don't realize that "show us the error" means "show us the exact
                    text of the error, with no omissions or abridgements." The first time
                    you work with such a user, you need to be specific about that.
                    Finally, it offers a pointer to much more detailed and complete
                    instructions for reporting bugs. If you have successfully engaged
                    with the user, he will often take the time to read that document and
                    do what it says. This means, of course, that you have to have the
                    document prepared in advance. It should give clear instructions about
                    what kind of information your development team wants to see in every
                    bug report. Ideally, it should also evolve over time in response to
                    the particular sorts of omissions and misreports users tend to make
                    for your project.</p>

                                                                              href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html"
                                                                              target="_top">subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html</a>,
                    are a fairly
                    standard example of the form. Notice how they include an
                    invitation to provide a patch to fix the bug. This is not because
                    such an invitation will lead to a greater patch/report
                    ratioâmost users who are capable of fixing bugs already know
                    that a patch would be welcome, and don't need to be told. The
                    invitation's real purpose is to emphasize to all readers, especially
                    those new to the project or new to free software in general, that the
                    project runs on participation. In a sense, the project's
                    current developers are no more responsible for fixing the bug than is
                    the person who reported it. This is an important point that many new
                    users will not be familiar with. Once they realize it, they're more
                    likely to help make the fix happen, if not by contributing code then
                    by providing a more thorough reproduction recipe, or by offering to
                    test fixes that other people post. The goal is to make every user
                    realize that there is no <span class="emphasis"><em>innate</em></span> difference
                    between himself and the people who work on the projectâthat
                    it's a question of how much time and effort one puts in, not a
                    question of who one is.</p>

                <p>The admonition against responding angrily does not apply to rude
                    users. Occasionally people post bug reports or complaints that,
                    regardless of their informational content, show a sneering contempt at
                    the project for some failing. Often such people are alternately
                    insulting and flattering, such as the person who posted this to a
                    Subversion mailing list:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Why is it that after almost 6 days there still aren't any
                        binaries posted for the windows platform?!? It's the same story every
                        time and it's pretty frustrating. Why aren't these things automated
                        so that they could be available immediately?? When you post an "RC"
                        build, I think the idea is that you want users to test the build, but
                        yet you don't provide any way of doing so. Why even have a soak
                        period if you provide no means of testing??</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>Initial response to this rather inflammatory post was
                    surprisingly restrained: people pointed out that the project had a
                    published policy of not providing official binaries, and said, with
                    varying degrees of annoyance, that he ought to volunteer to produce
                    them himself if they were so important to him. Believe it or not, his
                    next post started with these lines:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>First of all, let me say that I think Subversion is awesome and
                        I really appreciate the efforts of everyone involved. [...]</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>...and then he went on to berate the project
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>again</em></span> for not providing binaries, while
                    still not volunteering to do anything about it. After that, about
                    50 people just jumped all over him, and I can't say I really
                    minded. Retaliatory rudeness should be avoided toward people with
                    whom the project has (or would like to have) a sustained interaction.
                    But when someone makes it clear from the start that he is going to
                    be a fountain of bile, there is no point making him feel welcome.</p>

                <p>Such situations are fortunately quite rare, and they are
                    noticeably rarer in projects that make an effort to engage users
                    constructively and courteously from their very first
                    interaction.</p></div>

            </div>
            <p>Share the management burden as well as the technical burden of
                running the project. As a project becomes more complex, an increasing
                proportion of the work becomes about managing people and information flow.
                There is no reason not to share that burden, and sharing it does not
                necessarily require a top-down hierarchy either. In fact, what happens in
                practice tends to be more of a peer-to-peer network topology than a
                military-style command structure.</p>

            <p>Sometimes management roles are formalized and sometimes they
                happen spontaneously. In the Subversion project, we have a patch
                manager, a translation manager, documentation managers, issue managers
                (albeit unofficial), and a release manager. Some of these roles we
                made a conscious decision to initiate, others just happened by
                themselves. Here we'll examine these roles, and a couple of others,
                in detail (except for release manager, which was already covered in
                <a class="xref" href="#release-manager" title="Release manager">the section called âRelease managerâ</a>
                and <a class="xref" href="#release-owner" title="Dictatorship by Release Owner">the section called
                    âDictatorship by Release Ownerâ</a><span> earlier in this
chapter</span>).</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="&quot;Manager&quot; Does Not Mean &quot;Owner&quot;">
                <div class="titlepage">

                </div>
                <a name="faq-manager"></a>

                <p>As you read the role descriptions below, notice that none of them
                    requires exclusive control over the domain in question. The issue
                    manager does not prevent other people from making changes in the
                    tickets database, the FAQ manager does not insist on being the only
                    person to edit the FAQ, and so on. These roles are all about
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>responsibility without monopoly</em></span>. An important
                    part of each domain
                    manager's job is to notice when other people are working in that domain,
                    and train them to do the things the way the manager does, so that the
                    multiple efforts reinforce rather than conflict. Domain managers
                    should also document the processes by which they do their work, so
                    that when one leaves, someone else can pick up the slack right
                    away.</p>

                <p>Sometimes there is a conflict: two or more people want the same
                    role. There is no one right way to handle this. You just have to
                    draw on your knowledge of the project and of the people involved and
                    suggest a resolution. In some cases it will work to just put on your
                    "benevolent dictator" hat and choose one of the people. But I find
                    that a better technique is just to ask the multiple candidates to
                    settle it among themselves. They usually will, and will be more
                    satisfied with the result than if a decision had been imposed on them
                    from the outside. They may even decide on a co-management
                    arrangement, which is fine if it works, and if it doesn't then you're
                    right back where you started and can try a different resolution.</p>

                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="patch-manager"></a>Patch Manager</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>In a free software project that receives a lot of patches,
                        keeping track of which patches have arrived and what has been decided
                        about them can be a nightmare, especially if done in a decentralized
                        way. Most patches arrive either as posts to the project's development
                        mailing list or as a pull request submitted through the version
                        control system, but there are a number of different routes a patch can
                        take after arrival.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes someone reviews the patch, finds problems, and bounces
                        it back to the original author for cleanup. This usually leads to an
                        iterative processâall visible in a public forumâin which
                        the original author posts revised versions of the patch until the
                        reviewer has nothing more to criticize. It is not always easy to tell
                        when this process is done: if the reviewer commits the patch, then
                        clearly the cycle is complete. But if she does not, it might be
                        because she simply didn't have time, or doesn't have commit access
                        herself and couldn't rope any of the other developers into doing
                        it.</p>

                    <p>Another frequent response to a patch is a freewheeling
                        discussion, not necessarily about the patch itself, but about whether
                        the concept behind the patch is good. For example, the patch may fix
                        a bug, but the project prefers to fix that bug in another way, as part
                        of solving a more general class of problems. Often this is not known
                        in advance, and it is the patch that stimulates the discovery.</p>

                    <p>Occasionally, a posted patch is met with utter silence. Usually
                        this is due to no developer having time <span class="emphasis"><em>at that
                            moment</em></span> to review the patch, so each hopes that someone else
                        will do it. Since there's no particular limit to how long each person
                        waits for someone else to pick up the ball, and meanwhile other
                        priorities are always coming up, it's very easy for a patch to be
                        ignored permanently without any single person intending for that to
                        happen. The project might miss out on a useful patch this way, and
                        there are other harmful side effects as well: it is discouraging to
                        the author, who invested work in the patch, and it is discouraging
                        to others considering writing patches.</p>

                    <p>The patch manager's job is to make sure that patches don't "slip
                        through the cracks." This is done by following every patch through to
                        some sort of stable state. The patch manager watches every issue
                        tracker discussion, pull request, or mailing list thread that results
                        from a patch
                        posting. If it ends with a commit of the patch, he does nothing. If it
                        goes into a review/revise iteration, ending with a final version of
                        the patch but no commit, he creates or updates a ticket to point to
                        the final version, and to any discussion around it, so that there is a
                        permanent record for developers to follow up on later. In projects
                        that use a patch queue manager or review tool (e.g., <a class="ulink"
                                                                                href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/"
                                                                                target="_top">Gerrit</a>, <a
                                class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_Board" target="_top">Review_Board</a>,
                        etc), the patch manager can help encourage
                        consistent usage of that tool, by putting patches there and watching
                        to make sure developers handle them there.</p>

                    <p>When a patch gets no reaction at all, the patch manager waits a
                        few days, then follows up asking if anyone is going to review it.
                        This usually gets a reaction: a developer may explain that she doesn't
                        think the patch should be applied, and give the reasons why, or she
                        may review it, in which case one of the previously described paths is
                        taken. If there is still no response, the patch manager may or may
                        not file a ticket for the patch, at his discretion, but at least the
                        original submitter got <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> reaction. The true
                        currency of open source projects is attention: people who can see that
                        they are getting attention will keep participating, even if not every
                        patch they submit lands.</p>

                    <p>Having a patch manager has saved the Subversion development team
                        a lot of time and mental energy. Without a designated person to take
                        responsibility, every developer would constantly have to worry "If I
                        don't have time to respond to this patch right now, can I count on
                        someone else doing it? Should I try to keep an eye on it? But if
                        other people are also keeping an eye on it, for the same reasons, then
                        we'd have needlessly duplicated effort." The patch manager removes
                        the second-guessing from the situation. Each developer can make the
                        decision that is right for her at the moment she first sees the patch.
                        If she wants to follow up with a review, she can do thatâthe
                        patch manager will adjust his behavior accordingly. If she wants to
                        ignore the patch completely, that's fine too; the patch manager will
                        make sure it isn't forgotten.</p>

                    <p>Because this system works only if people can depend on the patch
                        manager being there without fail, the role should be held formally.
                        In Subversion, we advertised for it on the development and users
                        mailing lists, got several volunteers, and took the first one who
                        replied. When that person had to step down (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#transitions" title="Transitions">the section called
                            âTransitionsâ</a><span> later in
this chapter</span>), we did the same thing again.
                        We've never tried having multiple people share the role, because of
                        the communications overhead that would be required between them; but
                        perhaps at very high volumes of patch submission, a multiheaded patch
                        manager might make sense.</p></div>

                    </div>
                    <p>In software projects, "translation" can refer to two somewhat
                        different things. It can mean translating the software's
                        documentation into other languages, or it can mean translating the
                        software itselfâthat is, having the program display errors and
                        help messages in the user's preferred language. Both are complex
                        tasks, but once the right infrastructure is in place, they are largely
                        separable from other development. Because the tasks are similar in
                        some ways, it may make sense (depending on your project) to have a
                        single translation manager handle both, or it may be better to have
                        two different managers.</p>

                    <p>In the Subversion project, we had one translation manager handle
                        both. He did not actually write the translations himself, of
                        courseâhe might help out on one or two, but would need to speak
                        more than ten languages fluently in order to work on all of them!
                        Instead, he managed teams of volunteer translators: he helped them
                        coordinate among each other, and he coordinated between the
                        translation teams and the rest of the project.</p>

                    <p>Part of the reason the translation manager is necessary is that
                        translators are a different demographic from developers. They
                        sometimes have little or no experience working in a version control
                        repository, or indeed with working as part of a distributed volunteer
                        team at all. But in other respects they are often the best kind of
                        volunteer: people with specific domain knowledge who saw a need and
                        chose to get involved. They are usually willing to learn, and
                        enthusiastic to get to work. All they need is someone to tell them
                        how. The translation manager makes sure that the translations happen
                        in a way that does not interfere unnecessarily with regular
                        development. He also serves as a sort of representative of the
                        translators as a unified body, whenever the developers must be
                        informed of technical changes required to support the translation
                        effort.</p>

                    <p>Thus, the position's most important skills are diplomatic, not
                        technical. For example, in Subversion we had a policy that all
                        translations should have at least two people working on them, because
                        otherwise there is no way for the text to be reviewed. When a new
                        volunteer shows up offering to translate Subversion to, say, Malagasy,
                        the translation manager has to either hook him up with someone who
                        posted six months ago expressing interest in doing a Malagasy
                        translation, or else politely ask the volunteer to go
                        find <span class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> Malagasy translator to work with as
                        a partner. Once enough people are available, the manager sets them up
                        with the proper kind of commit access, informs them of the project's
                        conventions (such as how to write log messages), and then keeps an eye
                        out to make sure they adhere to those conventions.</p>

                    <p>Conversations between the translation manager and the
                        developers, or between the translation manager and translation teams,
                        are usually held in the project's original languageâthat is, the
                        language from which all the translations are being made. For most
                        free software projects, this is English, but it doesn't matter what it
                        is as long as the project agrees on it. (English is probably best for
                        projects that want to attract a broad international development
                        community, though.)</p>

                    <p>Conversations <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> a particular
                        translation team usually happen in their shared language, however, and
                        one of the other tasks of the translation manager is to set up a
                        dedicated mailing list for each team. That way the translators can
                        discuss their work freely, without distracting people on the project's
                        main lists, most of whom would not be able to understand the
                        translation language anyway.</p>

                            thing. As <a class="ulink"

                            encodings is an internationalization move, since it's not about a
                            particular language, but rather about accepting text from any of a
                            number of languages. On the other hand, making your software print
                            all error messages in Slovenian, when it detects that it is running
                            in a Slovenian environment, is a localization move.</p>

                    <p>Keeping software documentation up-to-date is a never-ending
                        task. Every new feature or enhancement that goes into the code has
                        the potential to cause a change in the documentation. Also, once the
                        project's documentation reaches a certain level of completeness, you
                        will find that a lot of the patches people send in are for the
                        documentation, not for the code. This is because there are many more
                        people competent to fix bugs in prose than in code: all users are
                        readers, but only a few are programmers.</p>

                    <p>Documentation patches are usually easier to review and
                        apply than code patches. There is little or no testing to be done,
                        and the quality of the change can be evaluated quickly just by examination.
                        Since the quantity is high, but the review burden fairly low, the
                        ratio of administrative overhead to productive work is greater for
                        documentation patches than for code patches. Furthermore, most of the
                        patches will probably need some sort of adjustment, in order to
                        maintain a consistent authorial voice in the documentation. In many
                        cases, patches will overlap with or affect other patches, and need to
                        be adjusted with respect to each other before being committed.</p>

                    <p>Given the exigencies of handling documentation patches, and the
                        fact that the code base needs to be constantly monitored so the
                        documentation can be kept up-to-date, it makes sense to have one
                        person, or a small team, dedicated to the task. They can keep a
                        record of exactly where and how the documentation lags behind the
                        software, and they can have practiced procedures for handling large
                        quantities of patches in an integrated way.</p>

                    <p>Of course, this does not preclude other people in the project
                        from applying documentation patches on the fly, especially small ones,
                        as time permits. And the same patch manager (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#patch-manager" title="Patch Manager">the section called âPatch
                            Managerâ</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>) can track both code and
                        documentation patches, filing them wherever the development and
                        documentation teams want them, respectively. (If the total quantity of
                        patches ever exceeds one human's capacity to track, though, switching
                        to separate patch managers for code and documentation is probably a
                        good first step.) The point of a documentation team is to ensure that
                        there are people
                        who think of themselves as responsible for keeping the documentation
                        organized, up-to-date, and consistent with itself. In practice, this
                        means knowing the documentation intimately, watching the code base,
                        watching the changes
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>others</em></span> commit to the documentation, watching for
                        incoming documentation patches, and using all these information
                        sources to do whatever is necessary to keep the documentation
                        healthy. If the documentation is kept in a wiki, then of course the
                        wiki's "watch changes" feature can be very important to the
                        documentation managers, since (depending on the wiki's edit policy)
                        changes may land without going through a pre-change review process.</p></div>

                    <p>Bug report growth is proportional to user base growth, rather
                        than to the number of actual bugs in the software. That is, the
                        number of tickets in a project's bug tracker grows in proportion to

                        still expect the number of open tickets to grow essentially without
                        bound. The frequency of duplicate tickets will thus also increase, as
                        will the frequency of incomplete or poorly described tickets.</p>

                    <p>An <em class="firstterm">issue manager</em><sup>[<a name="idp9205616" href="#ftn.idp9205616"
                                                                           class="footnote">63</a>]</sup> helps cope
                        with this situation by watching what
                        goes into the database, and periodically sweeping through it looking
                        for specific problems. Their most common action is probably to fix up
                        incoming tickets, either because the reporter didn't set some of the
                        form fields correctly, or because the ticket is a duplicate of one
                        already in the database. Obviously, the more familiar an issue
                        manager is with the project's bug database, and with the
                        issue-tracking software's user interface and APIs, the more
                        efficiently she will be able to detect and handle duplicate tickets.
                        This is why it is often good to have a few people specialize in the
                        bug database, instead of everyone trying to do it <span class="foreignphrase"><em
                                class="foreignphrase">ad
                            hoc</em></span>. Although every developer in the project needs a
                        certain basic level of competence in manipulating the issue tracker,
                        having a few specialists becomes increasingly important as the project
                        matures. When a project tries to spread collective responsibility for
                        the bug database across everyone, no single individual acquires a deep
                        enough expertise in the content of the database or the tracker's
                        features.</p>

                    <p>Issue managers can help map between tickets and individual
                        developers. When there are a lot of bug reports coming in, not every
                        developer may read the ticket notification mailing list with equal
                        attention. However, if someone who knows the development team is
                        keeping an eye on all incoming tickets, then she can discreetly direct
                        certain developers' attention to specific bugs when appropriate. Of
                        course, this has to be done with a sensitivity to everything else
                        going on in development, and to the recipient's desires and
                        temperament. Therefore, it is often best for issue managers to be
                        developers themselves.</p>

                    <p>Depending on how your project uses the ticket tracker, issue
                        managers can also shape the database to reflect the project's
                        priorities. For example, in Subversion we scheduled tickets into
                        specific future releases, so that when someone asks "When will bug X
                        be fixed?" we could say "Two releases from now," even if we can't give
                        an exact date. The releases are represented in the ticket tracker as
                        target milestones (something most ticket trackers support). As a
                        rule, every Subversion release has one major new feature and a list of
                        specific bug fixes. We assigned the appropriate target milestone to
                        all the tickets planned for that release (including the new
                        featureâit got a ticket too), so that people could view the bug
                        database through the lens of release scheduling. These targets rarely
                        remain static, however. As new bugs come in, priorities sometimes get
                        shifted around, and tickets must be moved from one milestone to
                        another so that each release remains manageable. This, again, is best
                        done by people who have an overall sense of what's in the database,
                        and how various tickets relate to each other.</p>

                    <p>Another thing issue managers do is notice when tickets become
                        obsolete. Sometimes a bug is fixed accidentally as part of an
                        unrelated change to the software, or sometimes the project changes its
                        mind about whether a certain behavior is buggy. Finding obsoleted
                        tickets is not easy: the only way to do it systematically is by making
                        a sweep over all the tickets in the database. But full sweeps become less
                        and less feasible over time, as the number of tickets grows.
                        After a certain point, the only way to keep the database sane is to use a
                        divide-and-conquer approach: categorize tickets immediately on arrival
                        and direct them to the appropriate developer's or team's attention.
                        The recipient then takes charge of the ticket for the rest of its
                        lifetime, shepherding it to resolution or oblivion as necessary. When
                        the database is that large, the issue manager becomes more of an
                        overall coordinator, spending less time looking at each ticket herself
                        and more time getting it into the right person's hands.</p></div>

            <p>From time to time, a person in a position of ongoing
                responsibility (e.g., patch manager, translation manager, etc.) will
                become unable to perform the duties of the position. It may be
                because the job turned out to be more work than he anticipated, or it
                may be due to other factors: a change in responsibilities at his job,
                a new baby, or whatever.</p>

            <p>When a person gets swamped like this, he usually doesn't
                notice it right away. It happens by slow degrees, and there's no
                point at which he consciously realizes that he can no longer fulfill
                the duties of the role. Instead, the rest of the project just doesn't
                hear much from him for a while. Then there will suddenly be a flurry
                of activity, as he feels guilty for neglecting the project for so long
                and sets aside a night to catch up. Then you won't hear from him for
                a while longer, and then there might or might not be another flurry.
                But there's rarely an unsolicited formal resignation. To resign
                would mean openly acknowledging to himself that his circumstances have
                changed and that his ability to fulfill a committment has been
                permanently reduced. People are often reluctant to admit that.</p>

            <p>Therefore, it's up to you and the others in the project to
                notice what's happeningâor rather, not happeningâand to
                ask the person what's going on. The inquiry should be friendly and
                100% guilt-free. Your purpose is to find out a piece
                of information, not to make the person feel bad. Generally, the
                inquiry should be visible to the rest of the project, but if you know
                of some special reason why a private inquiry would be better, that's
                fine too. The main reason to do it publicly is so that if the
                person responds by saying that he won't be able to do the job
                anymore, there's a context established for your
                <span class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> public post: a request for a new person
                to fill that role.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, a person is unable to do the job he's taken on,
                but is either unaware or unwilling to admit that fact. Of course,
                anyone may have trouble at first, especially if the responsibility is
                complex. However, if someone just isn't working out in the role he's
                taken on, even after everyone else has given all the help and
                suggestions they can, then the only solution is for him to step aside
                and let someone new have a try. And if the person doesn't see this
                himself, he'll need to be told. There's basically only one way to
                handle this, I think, but it's a multistep process and each step is
                important.</p>

            <p>First, make sure you're not crazy. Privately talk to others in
                the project to see if they agree that the problem is as serious as you
                think it is. Even if you're already positive, this serves the purpose
                of letting others know that you're considering asking the person to
                step aside. Usually no one will object to thatâthey'll just be
                happy you're taking on the awkward task, so they don't have to!</p>

            <p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>privately</em></span> contact the person in
                question and tell him, kindly but directly, about the problems you
                see. Be specific, giving as many examples as possible. Make sure to
                point out how people had tried to help, but that the problems
                persisted without improving. You should expect this email to take a
                long time to write, but with this sort of message, if you don't back
                up what you're saying, you shouldn't say it at all. Say that you
                would like to find a someone new to fill the role, but also point
                out that there are many other ways to contribute to the project. At
                this stage, don't say that you've talked to others about it; nobody
                likes to be told that people were conspiring behind his back.</p>

            <p>There are a few different ways things can go after that. The
                most likely reaction is that he'll agree with you, or at any rate not
                want to argue, and be willing to step down. In that case, suggest
                that he make the announcement himself, and then you can follow up with
                a post seeking a replacement.</p>

            <p>Or, he may agree that there have been problems, but ask for a
                little more time (or for one more chance, in the case of discrete-task
                roles like release manager). How you react to that is a judgement
                call, but whatever you do, don't agree to it just because you feel
                like you can't refuse such a reasonable request. That would prolong
                the agony, not lessen it. There is often a very good reason to refuse
                the request, namely, that there have already been plenty of chances,
                and that's how things got to where they are now. Here's how I put it
                in a mail to someone who was filling the release manager role but was
                not really suited for it:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="screen">&gt; If you wish to replace me with some one else, I will gracefully
&gt; pass on the role to who comes next.  I have one request, which
&gt; I hope is not unreasonable.  I would like to attempt one more
&gt; release in an effort to prove myself.

I totally understand the desire (been there myself!), but in
this case, we shouldn't do the "one more try" thing.

This isn't the first or second release, it's the sixth or
seventh... And for all of those, I know you've been dissatisfied
with the results too (because we've talked about it before).  So
we've effectively already been down the one-more-try route.
Eventually, one of the tries has to be the last one... I think
[this past release] should be it.
</pre>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>In the worst case, the person may disagree outright. Then
                you have to accept that things are going to be awkward and plow ahead
                anyway. Now is the time to say that you talked to other people about
                it (but still don't say who until you have their permission, since
                those conversations were confidential), and that you don't think it's
                good for the project to continue as things are. Be insistent, but
                never threatening. Keep in mind that with most roles, the transition
                really happens the moment someone new starts doing the job,
                <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the moment the old person stops doing it.
                For example, if the contention is over the role of, say, issue
                manager, at any point you and other influential people in the project
                can solicit for a new issue manager. It's not actually necessary that
                the person who was previously doing it stop doing it, as long as he
                does not sabotage (deliberately or otherwise) the efforts of the new
                person.</p>

            <p>Which leads to a tempting thought: instead of asking the person
                to resign, why not just frame it as a matter of getting him some help?
                Why not just have two issue managers, or patch managers, or whatever
                the role is?</p>

            <p>Although that may sound nice in theory, it is generally not a
                good idea. What makes the manager roles workâwhat makes them
                useful, in factâis their centralization. Those things that can
                be done in a decentralized fashion are usually already being done that
                way. Having two people fill one managerial role introduces
                communications overhead between those two people, as well as the
                potential for slippery displacement of responsibility ("I thought you
                brought the first aid kit!" "Me? No, I thought
                <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> brought the first aid kit!"). Of course,
                there are exceptions. Sometimes two people work extremely well
                together, or the nature of the role is such that it can easily be
                spread across multiple people. But these are not likely to be applicable
                when you see someone flailing in a role he is not suited for. If
                he'd appreciated the problem in the first place, he would have sought
                such help before now. In any case, it would be disrespectful to let
                someone waste time continuing to do a job no one will pay attention
                to.</p>

            <p>The most important factor in asking someone to step down is
                privacy: giving him the space to make a decision without feeling like
                others are watching and waiting. I once made the mistakeâan
                obvious mistake, in retrospectâof mailing all three parties at
                once in order to ask Subversion's release manager to step aside in
                favor of two others who were ready to step up. I'd already talked to
                the two new
                people privately, and knew that they were willing to take on the
                responsibility. So I thought, naÃ¯vely and somewhat
                insensitively, that I'd save some time and hassle by sending one mail
                to all of them to initiate the transition. I assumed that the current
                release manager was already fully aware of the problems and would see
                the reasonableness of my point immediately.</p>

            <p>I was wrong. The current release manager was very offended, and
                rightly so. It's one thing to be asked to hand off the job; it's
                another thing to be asked that <span class="emphasis"><em>in front of</em></span> the
                people you'll hand it off to. Once I got it through my head why he
                was offended, I apologized. He eventually did step aside gracefully,
                and continues to be involved with the project today. But his
                feelings were hurt, and needless to say, this was not the most
                auspicious of beginnings for the new release managers either.</p></div>

                </div>
                <p>For the purposes of this section, the word
                    <em class="firstterm">committer</em> means one of the official
                    maintainers of the software&nbsp;â&nbsp;a committer is someone
                    who has <em class="firstterm">commit access</em>: the right to make
                    changes to the copy of the code that will be used for the project's
                    next official release.</p>

                <p>This precise definition is important because, after all,
                    anyone can set up a repository containing a copy of the project's
                    code and allow themselves to commit to that repository; indeed,
                    doing so is a standard development procedure with decentralized
                    version control systems such as Git. But what really matters for
                    the project's purposes is who has the ability to put changes into
                    the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> copy&nbsp;â&nbsp;that is, the
                    central shared copy into which contributors' changes are merged and
                    from which releases are made.</p>

                <p>Because in older, centralized version control systems, there
                    was normally only one repository anyway, the term "commit access"
                    corresponded closely to who was actually using the "commit" command
                    (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-commit"><em class="firstterm">commit</em></a><span>

                    changes into the group's shared repository. These days it
                    corresponds to those who run the "push" or "pull" commands (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-push"><em class="firstterm">push</em></a> and <a class="xref"

                        <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) to put changes into
                    that repository. It is the same idea either way: the master
                    repository is a social concept, not a technical concept, and the
                    mechanics of how changes get into it are not important here. Open
                    source projects continue to use the term "committer" as a synonym
                    for "official maintainer", even though formally speaking the
                    "commit" command is no longer where the gating happens.</p></div>
            <p>As the only formally distinct class of people found in all open
                source projects, committers deserve special attention in this book.
                Committers are an unavoidable concession to discrimination in a system
                which is otherwise as non-discriminatory as possible. But
                "discrimination" is not meant as a pejorative here. The function
                committers perform is utterly necessary, and I do not think a project
                could succeed without it. Quality control requires, well, control.
                There are always many people who feel competent to make changes to a
                program, and some smaller number who actually are. The project cannot
                rely on people's own judgement; it must impose standards and grant
                commit access only to those who meet them. On the other
                hand, having people who can commit changes directly working
                side-by-side with people who cannot sets up an obvious power dynamic.
                That dynamic must be managed so that it does not harm the
                project.</p>

            <p>In <a class="xref" href="#electorate" title="Who Votes?">the section called âWho Votes?â</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>, we already
                discussed the mechanics of considering new committers. Here we will
                look at the standards by which potential new committers should be
                judged, and how this process should be presented to the larger
                community.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Choosing Committers">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="choosing-committers"></a>Choosing Committers</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In the Subversion project, we choose committers primarily on the
                    Hippocratic Principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>first, do no harm</em></span>. Our
                    main criterion is not technical skill or even knowledge of the code,
                    but merely that the person show good judgement. Judgement includes
                    knowing what not to take on. Someone might post only small patches,
                    fixing fairly simple problems in the code, but if her patches apply
                    cleanly, do not contain bugs, and are mostly in accord with the
                    project's log message and coding conventions, and there are enough
                    patches to show a clear pattern, then an existing committer will
                    usually propose her for commit access. If at least three people say
                    yes, and no one objects, then the offer is made. True, we might have
                    no evidence that the person is able to solve complex problems in all
                    areas of the code base, but that is irrelevant: the person has made it
                    clear that she is capable of judging her own abilities, and that is
                    the important thing. Technical skills can be learned (and taught),
                    but judgement, for the most part, cannot. Therefore, it is the one
                    thing you want to make sure a person has before you give her commit
                    access.</p>

                <p>When a new committer proposal does provoke a discussion, it is
                    usually not about technical ability, but rather about the person's
                    behavior in the project's discussion forums. Sometimes someone shows
                    technical skill and an ability to work within the project's formal
                    guidelines, yet is also consistently belligerent or uncooperative in
                    public forums. That's a serious concern; if the person doesn't seem
                    to shape up over time, even in response to hints, then we won't add
                    her as a committer no matter how skilled she is. In a volunteer
                    group, social skills, or the ability to "play well in the sandbox",
                    are as important as raw technical ability. Because everything is
                    under version control, the penalty for adding a committer you
                    shouldn't have added is not so much the problems it could cause in the
                    code (review would spot those quickly anyway), but that it might
                    eventually force the project to revoke the person's commit
                    accessâan action that is never pleasant and can sometimes be
                    confrontational.</p>

                <p>Some projects insist that the potential committer demonstrate a
                    certain level of technical expertise and persistence, by submitting
                    some number of nontrivial patchesâthat is, not only do these
                    projects want to know that the person will do no harm, they want to
                    know that she is likely to do good across the code base. This isn't
                    necessarily harmful, but be careful that it doesn't start to turn
                    committership into a matter of membership in an exclusive club. The
                    question to keep in everyone's mind should be "What will bring the
                    best results for the code?" not "Will we devalue the social status
                    associated with committership by admitting this person?" The point of
                    commit access is not to reinforce people's self-worth, it's to allow
                    good changes to enter the code with a minimum of fuss. If you have
                    100 committers, 10 of whom make large changes on a regular basis, and
                    the other 90 of whom just fix typos and small bugs a few times a year,
                    that's still better than having only the 10.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Revoking Commit Access">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="revoking-committers"></a>Revoking Commit Access</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The first thing to be said about revoking commit access is: try
                    not to be in that situation in the first place. Depending on whose
                    access is being revoked, and why, the discussions around such an
                    action can be very divisive. Even when not divisive, they will be a
                    time-consuming distraction from productive work.</p>

                <p>However, if you must do it, the discussion should be had
                    privately among the same people who would be in a position to vote for
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>granting</em></span> that person whatever flavor of commit
                    access they currently have. The person himself should not be
                    included. This contradicts the usual injunction against secrecy, but
                    in this case it's necessary. First, no one would be able to speak
                    freely otherwise. Second, if the motion fails, you don't necessarily
                    want the person to know it was ever considered, because that could
                    open up questions ("Who was on my side? Who was against me?") that
                    lead to the worst sort of factionalism. In certain rare
                    circumstances, the group may want someone to know that revocation of
                    commit access is or was being considered, as a warning, but this
                    openness should be a decision the group makes. No one should ever, on
                    her own initiative, reveal information from a discussion and ballot
                    that others assumed were secret.</p>

                <p>Once someone's access is revoked, that fact is unavoidably
                    public (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#commit-access-openness" title="Avoid Mystery">the section called âAvoid
                        Mysteryâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so try to be as tactful as you can in
                    how it is presented to the outside world.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Partial Commit Access">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="partial-committers"></a>Partial Commit Access</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Some projects offer gradations of commit access. For example,
                    there might be contributors whose commit access gives them free rein
                    in the documentation, but who do not commit to the code itself.
                    Common areas for partial commit access include documentation,
                    translations, binding code to other programming languages,
                    specification files for packaging (e.g., RedHat RPM spec files,
                    etc.), and other places where a mistake will not result in a problem for
                    the core project.</p>

                <p>Since commit access is not only about committing, but about
                    being part of an electorate (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#electorate" title="Who Votes?">the section called âWho Votes?â</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>),
                    the question naturally arises: what can the partial committers vote
                    on? There is no one right answer; it depends on what sorts of partial
                    commit domains your project has. In Subversion things are
                    fairly simple: a partial committer can vote on matters confined
                    exclusively to that committer's domain, and not on anything else.
                    Importantly, we do have a mechanism for casting advisory votes
                    (essentially, the committer writes "+0" or "+1&nbsp;(non-binding)"
                    instead of just "+1" on the ballot). There's no reason to silence
                    people just because their vote isn't formally binding.</p>

                <p>Full committers can vote on anything, just as they can commit
                    anywhere, and only full committers vote on adding new committers of
                    any kind. In practice, though, the ability to add new partial
                    committers is usually delegated: any full committer can "sponsor" a
                    new partial committer, and partial committers in a domain can often
                    essentially choose new committers for that same domain (this is
                    especially helpful in making translation work run smoothly).</p>

                <p>Your project may need a slightly different arrangement,
                    depending on the nature of the work, but the same general principles
                    apply to all projects. Each committer should be able to vote on
                    matters that fall within the scope of her commit access, and not on
                    matters outside that, and votes on procedural questions should default
                    to the full committers, unless there's some reason (as decided by the
                    full committers) to widen the electorate. Remember that voting should
                    be rare anyway (see <a class="xref" href="#when-to-vote" title="When To Vote">the section called
                        âWhen To Voteâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>), except for
                    technical votes such as the change voting described in <a class="xref" href="#release-voting"
                                                                              title="Voting on Changes">the section

                <p>Regarding enforcement of partial commit access: it's often
                    best <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have the version control system
                    enforce partial commit domains, even if it is capable of doing so.

                </div>
                <p>Some projects automatically remove people's commit access if
                    they go a certain amount of time (say, a year) without committing
                    anything. I think this is usually unhelpful and even
                    counterproductive, for two reasons.</p>

                <p>First, it may tempt some people into committing acceptable but
                    unnecessary changes, just to prevent their commit access from
                    expiring. Second, it doesn't really serve any purpose. If the
                    main criterion for granting commit access is good judgement, then why
                    assume someone's judgement would deteriorate just because she's been away
                    from the project for a while? Even if she completely vanishes for
                    years, not looking at the code or following development discussions,
                    when she reappears she'll <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> how out of touch
                    she is, and act accordingly. You trusted her judgement before, so
                    why not trust it always? If high school diplomas do not expire, then
                    commit access certainly shouldn't.</p>

                <p>Sometimes a committer may ask to be removed, or to be explicitly
                    marked as dormant in the list of committers (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#commit-access-openness" title="Avoid Mystery">the section called âAvoid
                        Mysteryâ</a><span>
below</span> for more about that list). In these cases, the project
                    should accede to the person's wishes, of course.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Avoid Mystery">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Although the discussions around adding any particular new
                    committer must be confidential, the rules and procedures themselves
                    need not be secret. In fact, it's best to publish them, so people
                    realize that the committers are not some mysterious Star Chamber,
                    closed off to mere mortals, but that anyone can join simply by posting
                    good patches and knowing how to handle herself in the community.
                    In the Subversion project, we put this information right in the
                    developer guidelines document, since the people most likely to be
                    interested in how commit access is granted are those thinking of
                    contributing code to the project.</p>

                <p>In addition to publishing the procedures, publish the
                    actual <span class="emphasis"><em>list</em></span> of committers. It often goes in a
                    file called <code class="filename">MAINTAINERS</code> or
                    <code class="filename">COMMITTERS</code> or something like that, in the top
                    level of the project's source code tree. It should list all the full
                    committers first,
                    followed by the various partial commit domains and the members of each
                    domain. Each person should be listed by name and email address,
                    though the address can be encoded to prevent spam (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#address-hiding" title="Address hiding in archives">the section called

                <p>Since the distinction between full commit and partial commit
                    access is obvious and well defined, it is proper for the list to make
                    that distinction too. Beyond that, the list should not try to
                    indicate the informal distinctions that inevitably arise in a project,
                    such as who is particularly influential and how. It is a public

            <p>Credit is the primary currency of the free software world.
                Whatever people may say about their motivations for participating in a
                project, I don't know many developers who would be happy doing all
                their work anonymously, or under someone else's name. There are
                tangible reasons for this: one's reputation in a project roughly
                governs how much influence one has, and participation in an open
                source project can also indirectly have monetary value, because
                many employers now look for it on resumÃ©s<sup>[<a name="idp5277920" href="#ftn.idp5277920"
                                                                  class="footnote">64</a>]</sup>. There are also
                intangible reasons, perhaps even more powerful: people simply want to
                be appreciated, and instinctively look for signs that their work was
                recognized by others. The promise of credit is therefore one of best
                motivators the project has. When small contributions are
                acknowledged, people come back to do more.</p>

            <p>One of the most important features of collaborative development
                software (see <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                 title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i>Technical
                    Infrastructure</i></a>) is that
                it keeps accurate records of who did what, when. Wherever possible,
                use these existing mechanisms to make sure that credit is distributed
                accurately, and be specific about the nature of the contribution.
                Don't just write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;" if
                instead you can write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;
                for the bug report and reproduction recipe" in a log message.</p>

            <p>In Subversion, we have an informal but consistent policy of
                crediting the reporter of a bug in either the ticket filed, if there
                is one, or the log message of the commit that fixes the bug, if not.
                A quick survey of Subversion commit logs up to commit number 14525
                shows that about 10% of commits give credit to someone by name and
                email address, usually the person who reported or analyzed the bug
                fixed by that commit. Note that this person is different from the
                developer who actually made the commit, whose name is already recorded
                automatically by the version control system. As of mid-2005, when I
                last did this calculation, slightly over â were credited in the
                commit logs, usually multiple times, before they became committers
                themselves. This does not, of course, prove that being credited was a
                factor in their continued involvement, but it surely can't hurt to
                set up an atmosphere in which people know they can count on their
                contributions being acknowledged.</p>

            <p>It is important to distinguish between routine acknowledgment
                and special thanks. When discussing a particular piece of code, or
                some other contribution someone made, it is fine to acknowledge their
                work. For example, saying "Daniel's recent changes to the delta code
                mean we can now implement feature X" simultaneously helps people
                identify which changes you're talking about and acknowledges Daniel's
                work. On the other hand, posting solely to thank Daniel for the delta
                code changes serves no immediate practical purpose. It doesn't add
                any information, since the version control system and other mechanisms
                have already recorded the fact that he made the changes. Thanking
                everyone for everything would be distracting and ultimately
                information-free, since thanks are effective largely by how much they
                stand out from the default, background level of favorable comment
                going on all the time. This does not mean, of course, that you should
                never thank people. Just make sure to do it in ways that tend not to
                lead to credit inflation. Following these guidelines will
                help:</p>

                        should feel to express thanks there. For example,
                        thanking someone for their bugfix in passing during an IRC
                        conversation is fine, as is an aside in an email devoted
                        mainly to other topics. But don't post a new email solely
                        to thank someone, unless it's for a truly unusual feat, or
                        if it's just one followup in a topic-specific thread

                        the attitude that expressing thanks is something you do
                        when someone contributes even more than you thought she
                        would. Thus, to constantly thank regular contributors for

                            from time to time. The canonical example is the release

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>At its most basic, a <em class="firstterm">fork</em> is when one
                    copy of a project diverges from another copy: think "fork in the
                    road".</p>

                <p>What such divergence means for the project depends on the
                    intentions behind the fork. There are two types of forks, which I
                    will call <em class="firstterm">short forks</em> and <em class="firstterm">social
                        forks</em>. The distinction between them is important.</p>

                <p>Short forks are very common; in fact, they are the normal way
                    development is done in most projects today. A developer creates her
                    own public copy of the project's master repository, makes some
                    changes, then submits the changes back to the project directly from
                    the forked copy.<sup>[<a name="idp9312528" href="#ftn.idp9312528" class="footnote">65</a>]</sup>
                    Short forks are done on a routine basis as
                    part of daily development, and have no negative effect on the social
                    cohesiveness of the project.</p>

                <p>Social forks are much less common, and are much more significant
                    when they happen. A social fork is when a group of developers is
                    unhappy with the direction of the project and decides to create a
                    divergent version more in line with their own vision. Of course, one
                    of the technical actions required for such this is to create their own
                    copy of the project's repository, and perhaps of its bug database and
                    other resources as well. But this new copy of the project represents
                    a potentially permanent divergence, and developers on both sides of
                    the fork are aware of this; thus, it is a completely different beast
                    from a cooperative short fork.</p>

                <p>A social fork is almost always accompanied by long discussions
                    and rationales, in which developers try to persuade each other of the
                    merits of one or the other side of the fork, or of the merits of
                    ending the fork and reunifying. Since social forks have implications
                    for a project's stability and ability to continue attracting
                    developers, knowing how to constructively initiate or react to a
                    social fork of your project is useful&nbsp;â&nbsp;useful even if
                    a fork never happens, as understanding what leads to social forks, and
                    signalling clearly how you will behave in such an event, can sometimes
                    prevent the fork from happening in the first place.</p>

                <p>The rest of this section is about social forks, not short forks.
                    To save space, I will just use the word "fork" instead of "social
                    fork".</p></div>
            <p>In <a class="xref" href="#forkability" title="Forkability">the section called âForkabilityâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>, we saw how
                the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span> to fork has important effects on
                how projects are governed. But what happens when a fork actually
                occurs? How should you handle it, and what effects can you expect it
                to have? Conversely, when should you <span class="emphasis"><em>initiate</em></span> a
                fork?</p>

            <p>The answers depend on what kind of fork it is. Some forks are
                due to amicable but irreconcilable disagreements about the direction
                of the project; perhaps more are due to both technical disagreements
                and interpersonal conflicts. Of course, it's not always possible to
                tell the difference between the two, as technical arguments may
                involve personal elements as well. What all forks have in common is
                that one group of developers (or sometimes even just one developer)
                has decided that the costs of working with some or all of the others
                now outweigh the benefits.</p>

            <p>Once a project forks, there is no definitive answer to the
                question of which fork is the "true" or "original" project. People
                will colloquially talk of fork F coming out of project P, as though P
                is continuing unchanged down some natural path while F diverges into
                new territory, but this is, in effect, a declaration of how that
                particular observer feels about it. It is fundamentally a matter of
                perception: when a large enough percentage of observers agree, the
                assertion starts to become true. It is not the case that there is an
                objective truth from the outset, one that we are only imperfectly able to
                perceive at first. Rather, the perceptions <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
                the objective truth, since ultimately a projectâor a
                forkâis an entity that exists only in people's minds
                anyway.</p>

            <p>If those initiating the fork feel that they are
                sprouting a new branch off the main project, the perception question
                is resolved immediately and easily. Everyone, both developers and
                users, will treat the fork as a new project, with a new name (perhaps
                based on the old name, but easily distinguishable from it), a separate
                web site, and a separate philosophy or goal. Things get messier,
                however, when both sides feel they are the legitimate guardians of the
                original project and therefore have the right to continue using the
                original name. If there is some organization with trademark rights to
                the name (see <a class="xref" href="#trademarks" title="Trademarks">the section called
                    âTrademarksâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
      title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10, <i>Legal
                    Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a></span>), or legal control over the
                domain
                or web pages, that usually
                resolves the issue by fiat: that organization will decide who is the
                original project and who is the fork, because it holds all the cards in a
                public relations war. Naturally, things rarely get that far: since
                everyone already knows what the power dynamics are, they will avoid
                fighting a battle whose outcome is known in advance, and just jump
                straight to the end.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, in most cases there is little doubt as to which is
                the project and which is the fork, because a fork is, in essence, a vote
                of confidence. If more than half of the developers are in favor of
                whatever course the fork proposes to take, usually there is no need to
                forkâthe project can simply go that way itself, unless it is run
                as a dictatorship with a particularly stubborn dictator. On the other
                hand, if fewer than half of the developers are in favor, the fork is a
                clearly minority rebellion, and both courtesy and common sense
                indicate that it should think of itself as the divergent branch rather
                than the main line.</p>

            <p>When a fork occurs, there can be a question of what happens to
                non-copyable assets: not just trademarks, but perhaps money in the
                bank, hardware, that full-color conference banner sitting in a storage
                locker somewhere, etc. Sometimes, those questions are resolved
                independently of the project's decision-making procdures, because
                those assets already had formal owners, and in each case the owner
                will decide what happens to the asset. But in cases where the actual
                ownership is in dispute, or the asset belongs in some way to the
                project as a whole, there is no magic answer. If someone decides to
                make a fuss, the dispute might wind up in a court of law. In this
                respect, open source projects are not different from any other
                endeavor involving multiple people: when agreement cannot be reached
                but no one is willing to give in, the last resort is the legal system.
                It is extremely rare, however, for things to go that far in a free
                software project (I can't think of any examples, actually), because
                usually there is no participant for whom going to court is a better
                option than just giving up their side of the argument anyway.</p>

                    remember your long-term goals. The mere
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a fork isn't what hurts a project;
                    rather, it's the loss of developers and users. Your real aim,
                    therefore, is not to squelch the fork, but to minimize these harmful
                    effects. You may be mad, you may feel that the fork was unjust and
                    uncalled for, but expressing that publicly can only alienate undecided
                    developers. Instead, don't force people to make exclusive choices,
                    and be as cooperative as is practicable with the fork.</p>

                <p>Don't remove someone's commit access in your project just because she
                    decided to work on the fork. Work on the fork doesn't mean that
                    person has suddenly lost her competence to work on the original
                    project; committers before should remain committers afterward. Beyond
                    that, you should express your desire to remain as compatible as
                    possible with the fork, and say that you hope developers will port
                    changes between the two whenever appropriate. If you have
                    administrative access to the project's servers, publicly offer the
                    forkers infrastructure help at startup time. For example, offer them
                    a complete export of the bug database if there's no other way for them
                    to get it. Ask them if there's anything else
                    they need, and provide it if you can. Bend over backward to show
                    that you are not standing in the way, and that you want the fork to
                    succeed or fail on its own merits and nothing else.</p>

                <p>The reason to do all thisâand do it publiclyâis not
                    to actually help the fork, but to persuade developers that your side
                    is a safe bet, by appearing as non-vindictive as possible. In war it
                    sometimes makes sense (strategic sense, if not human sense) to force
                    people to choose sides, but in free software it almost never does. In
                    fact, after a fork some developers often openly work on both projects,
                    doing their best to keep the two compatible. These developers help
                    keep the lines of communication open after the fork. They allow your
                    project to benefit from interesting new features in the fork (yes, the
                    fork may have things you want), and also increase the chances of a
                    merger down the road.</p>

                <p>Sometimes a fork becomes so successful that, even though it was
                    regarded even by its own instigators as a fork at the outset, it
                    becomes the version everybody prefers, and eventually supplants the
                    original by popular demand. A famous instance of this was the
                    GCC/EGCS fork. The <em class="firstterm">GNU Compiler Collection</em>
                    (<em class="firstterm">GCC</em>, formerly the <em class="firstterm">GNU C
                        Compiler</em>) is the most popular open source native-code
                    compiler, and also one of the
                    most portable compilers in the world. Due to disagreements between the GCC's
                    official maintainers and Cygnus Software,<sup>[<a name="idp9335840" href="#ftn.idp9335840"
                                                                      class="footnote">66</a>]</sup> one
                    of GCC's most active developer groups, Cygnus created a fork of GCC
                    called <em class="firstterm">EGCS</em>. The fork was deliberately
                    non-adversarial: the EGCS developers did not, at any point, try to
                    portray their version of GCC as a new official version. Instead, they
                    concentrated on making EGCS as good as possible, incorporating patches
                    at a faster rate than the official GCC maintainers. EGCS grew in
                    popularity, and eventually some major operating system distributors
                    decided to package EGCS as their default compiler instead of GCC. At
                    this point, it became clear to the GCC maintainers that holding on to
                    the "GCC" name while everyone switched to the EGCS fork would burden
                    everyone with a needless name change, yet do nothing to prevent the
                    switchover. So GCC adopted the EGCS codebase, and there is once again
                    a single GCC, but greatly improved because of the fork.</p>

                <p>This example shows why you cannot always regard a fork as an
                    unadulteratedly bad thing. A fork may be painful and unwelcome at the
                    time, but you cannot necessarily know whether it will succeed.
                    Therefore, you and the rest of the project should keep an eye on it,
                    and be prepared not only to absorb features and code where possible,
                    but in the most extreme case to even join the fork if it gains the
                    bulk of the project's mindshare. Of course, you will often be able to
                    predict a fork's likelihood of success by seeing who joins it. If the
                    fork is started by the project's biggest complainer and is joined by a
                    handful of disgruntled developers who weren't behaving constructively
                    anyway, they've essentially solved a problem for you by forking, and
                    you probably don't need to worry about the fork taking momentum away
                    from the original project. But if you see influential and respected
                    developers supporting the fork, you should ask yourself why. Perhaps
                    the project was being overly restrictive, and the best solution is to
                    adopt into the mainline project some or all of the changes
                    contemplated by the forkâin essence, to avoid the fork by
                    becoming it.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Initiating a Fork">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="forks-initiating"></a>Initiating a Fork</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>All the advice below assumes that you are forking as a last
                    resort. Exhaust all other possibilities before starting a fork.
                    Forking almost always means losing developers, with only an uncertain
                    promise of gaining new ones later. It also means starting out with
                    competition for users' attention: everyone who's about to install the
                    software has to ask themselves: "Hmm, do I want that one or the other
                    one?" Whichever one you are, the situation is messy, because a
                    question has been introduced that wasn't there before. Some people
                    maintain that forks are healthy for the software ecosystem as a whole,
                    by a standard natural selection argument: the fittest will survive,
                    which means that, in the end, everyone gets better software. This may
                    be true from the ecosystem's point of view, but it's not true from the
                    point of view of any individual project. Most forks do not succeed,
                    and most projects are not happy to be forked.</p>

                <p>A corollary is that you should not use the threat of a fork as
                    an extremist debating techniqueâ"Do things my way or I'll fork
                    the project!"âbecause everyone is aware that a fork that fails
                    to attract developers away from the original project is unlikely to
                    survive long. All observersânot just developers, but users and
                    operating system packagers tooâwill make their own judgement about
                    which side to choose. You should therefore appear extremely reluctant
                    to fork, so that if you finally do it, you can credibly claim it was
                    the only route left.</p>

                <p>Do not neglect to take <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> factors into
                    account in evaluating the potential success of your fork. For
                    example, if many of the developers on a project have the same
                    employer, then even if they are disgruntled and privately in favor of
                    a fork, they are unlikely to say so out loud if they know that their
                    employer is against it. Many free software programmers like to think
                    that having a free license on the code means no one company can
                    dominate development. It is true that the license is, in an ultimate
                    sense, a guarantor of freedom: if others want badly enough to
                    fork the project, and have the resources to do so, they can. But in
                    practice, some projects' development teams are mostly funded by one
                    entity, and there is no point pretending that the entity's support
                    doesn't matter. If it is opposed to the fork, its developers are
                    unlikely to take part, even if they secretly want to.</p>

                <p>If, after careful consideration, you still conclude that you
                    must fork, line up support
                    privately first, then announce the fork in a non-hostile tone. Even
                    if you are angry at, or disappointed with, the current maintainers,
                    don't say that in the message. Just dispassionately state what led
                    you to the decision to fork, and that you mean no ill will toward the
                    project from which you're forking. Assuming that you do consider it a
                    fork (as opposed to an emergency preservation of the original
                    project), emphasize that you're forking the code and not the name, and
                    choose a name that does not conflict with the project's name. You can
                    use a name that contains or refers to the original name, as long as it
                    does not open the door to identity confusion. Of course it's fine to
                    explain prominently on the fork's home page that it descends from the
                    original program, and even that it hopes to supplant it. Just don't
                    make users' lives harder by forcing them to untangle an identity
                    dispute.</p>

                <p>Finally, you can get things started on the right foot by
                    automatically granting <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> committers of the
                    original project commit
                    access to the fork, including even those who openly disagreed with the
                    need for a fork. Even if they never use the access, your message is
                    clear: there are disagreements here, but no enemies, and you welcome
                    code contributions from any competent source.</p></div>

                The key in that case, I think, is that many of the authors come from a

            <p>It has become clear to me, partly through the consulting work I
                have done in the years since the first edition of this book, that
                organizations have particular adjustments to make when launching or
                participating in open source projects, in a way that individuals do
                not. Any organization contains formal management structures and
                informal social structures; these structures can be affected by
                engagement with open source projects, and sometimes need to be changed
                so that the organization as a whole is better able to support open
                source activity by the individuals within it. Furthermore, one kind
                of organization&nbsp;â&nbsp;government
                agencies&nbsp;â&nbsp;has special concerns when working with open
                source projects.</p>

            <p>This chapter therefore examines organizational issues generally
                and some issues specific to government agencies. Note that even if
                you're interested mainly in governments and open source, you should
                look the whole chapter, as the advice intended for organizations in
                general also applies to governments.</p></div>

            <p>This section is mainly about government agencies producing new
                open source software, and participating in existing open source
                projects; I'll also look at government usage of open source software,
                to the extent that it overlaps with those main topics.</p>

            <p>Since the first edition of this book in 2005, I've worked with
                various U.S. government agencies, at the federal, state, and municipal
                levels, to help them release open source software. I've also been
                lucky enough to observe, and in a few cases work with, some government
                agencies outside the U.S. These experiences have convinced me of one
                thing: government is different. If you work at a government agency
                and the material in this book so far has made you shake your head and
                think "Sure, but it'll never work here", you don't have to convince
                me&nbsp;â&nbsp;I already know what you mean. Governments differ
                from individuals and from private-sector organizations in some
                fundamental ways:

            </p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                    <li class="listitem">Governments often aren't trying to retain technical
                        expertise in-house (that's what contractors are for).
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem">Governments have labyrinthine and in certain ways
                        inflexible procurement and employment policies. These policies can
                        make it difficult for a government agency to be nimbly responsive in
                        an open source development community.
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem">Government agencies tend to be unusually risk-averse.
                        Somewhere at the top there's an elected official who, reasonably,
                        sees an open source project as just one more surface area for
                        opponents to attack. After all, when development happens in public,
                        the inevitable false starts and wrong turns are also public; if
                        development were internal, no one else would know about it when
                        those things happen.
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem">Government officials hunger for well-timed and
                        well-controlled publicity events. This has certain benefits, but it
                        can sometimes come at the expense of overall project health.
                        This need for publicity is the complement of being risk-averse:
                        elected officials and those who work for them understand that most
                        people aren't paying much attention most of the
                        time&nbsp;â&nbsp;therefore, those who work in government want
                        to ensure that in the few moments when people
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> paying attention, they see something
                        good. This is understandable, but it can cause them to delay
                        certain actions&nbsp;â&nbsp;or, in some cases, do them too
                        soon&nbsp;â&nbsp;based on external publicity implications
                        rather than on what's best for the project technically and
                        socially.

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>There are good reasons for all of these things; they've been
                true for decades if not centuries, and they're not going to change.
                So if you're a government agency and you want to start a successful
                open source project, certain adjustments will be necessary to
                compensate for the structural idiosyncracies above. The advice that
                follows is most applicable to the U.S. and countries with similar
                systems of government and civil service.</p>

                        section called âWaiting Just Creates an Exposure Eventâ</a>, is if anything even more true for
                    government code.</p>

                <p>Government projects have greater potential to be harmed by a
                    needless exposure event than private-sector projects have. Elected
                    officials and those who work for them are understandably sensitive to
                    negative public comments. Thus even for the most conscientious team,
                    a worrying cloud of uncertainty will surround everything by the time
                    you're ready to open up hitherto closed code. How can you ever know
                    you've got it all cleaned up? You do your best, but you can never be
                    totally sure some hawk-eyed hacker out there won't spot something
                    embarrassing after the release. The team worries, and worry is an
                    energy drain: it causes them to spend time chasing down ghosts, and at
                    the same time can cause them to unconsciously avoid steps that might
                    risk revealing real problems.</p>

                <p>This concern doesn't only apply to government software, of
                    course. But in the private sector, businesses sometimes have
                    competitive reasons to stay behind the curtain until their first
                    release, even if they intend for the project to be open source in the
                    long run. Government projects should not have that motivation to
                    start out closed, at least in theory, and they have even more to
                    lose.</p></div>

            <p>Legal questions have assumed a somewhat more prominent role in
                free software projects over the last decade or so. It is still the
                case that the most important things about your project are its the
                quality of its code, its features, and the health of its developer
                community. However, although all open source licenses share the same
                basic guarantees of freedom, their terms are not exactly the same in
                all details. The particular license your project uses can affect
                which entities decide to get involved in it and how. You will
                therefore need a basic understanding of free software licensing, both
                to ensure that the project's license is compatible with its goals, and
                to be able to discuss licensing decisions with others.</p>

            <p>Please note that I am not a lawyer, and that nothing in this
                book should be construed as formal legal advice. For that, you'll
                need to hire a lawyer or be one.</p></div>

            <p>In any discussion of open source licensing, the first thing that
                becomes apparent is that there seem to be many different words for the
                same thing: <em class="firstterm">free&nbsp;software</em>,
                <em class="firstterm">open&nbsp;source</em>,
                <em class="firstterm">FOSS</em>, <em class="firstterm">F/OSS</em>, and
                <em class="firstterm">FLOSS</em>. Let's start by sorting those
                out, along with a few other terms.</p>

            <div class="variablelist">
                <dl>

                    <dd><p>Software that can be freely shared and modified,
                        including in source code form. The term was first
                        coined by Richard Stallman, who codified it in the GNU
                        General Public License (GPL), and who founded the Free
                        Software Foundation (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_top">fsf.org</a>) to
                        promote the concept.</p>

                        <p>Although "free software" covers the
                            same set of software as "open source", the FSF, among
                            others, prefers the former term because it emphasizes
                            the idea of freedom, and the concept of
                            freely redistributable software as primarily a social
                            movement rather than a technical one. The FSF
                            acknowledges that the term is ambiguousâit could
                            mean "free" as in "zero-cost", instead of "free" as in
                            "freedom"âbut feels that it's still the best term,
                            all things considered, and that the other possibilities
                            in English have their own ambiguities. (Throughout this
                            book, "free" is used in the "freedom" sense, not the
                            "zero-cost" sense.)</p></dd>

                    <dd><p>Free software under another name. The
                        different name is sometimes used to indicate a philosophical
                        difference, however. In fact, the term "open source"
                        was coined by the group that founded the Open Source
                        Initiative (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/" target="_top">opensource.org</a>)
                        as a deliberate alternative to "free software". Their
                        goal at the time was largely to make such software a
                        more palatable choice for
                        corporations, by presenting it as a development
                        methodology rather than as a political
                        movement.<sup>[<a name="idp9750560" href="#ftn.idp9750560" class="footnote">67</a>]</sup></p>

                        <p>While any license that is free is also open
                            source, and vice versa (with a few minor exceptions that
                            have no practical consequences),
                            people tend to pick one term and stick with it. In
                            general, those who prefer "free software" are more
                            likely to have a philosophical or moral stance on the
                            issue, while those who prefer "open source" either don't
                            view it as a matter of freedom, or are not interested in
                            advertising the fact that they do. See

                        be three, and that is exactly what is happening with
                        terms for free software. The academic world, perhaps
                        wanting precision and inclusiveness over elegance, seems
                        to have settled on FOSS, or sometimes F/OSS, standing
                        for "Free / Open Source Software". Another variant
                        gaining momentum is FLOSS, which
                        stands for "Free / Libre Open Source Software"
                        (<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">libre</em></span> is familiar from
                        many Romance languages and does not suffer from the ambiguities

                        <p>All these terms mean the same thing:
                            software that can be modified and redistributed by
                            everyone, sometimesâbut not alwaysâwith the
                            requirement that derivative works be freely
                            redistributable under the same terms.</p></dd>

                        (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines" target="_top">debian.org/social_contract#guidelines</a>).
                        This is a widely-used test for whether a given license
                        is truly open source
                        (free, <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">libre</em></span>, etc.). The
                        Debian Project's mission is to maintain an entirely free
                        operating system, such that someone installing it need
                        never doubt that she has the right to modify and
                        redistribute any or all of the system. The Debian Free
                        Software Guidelines are the requirements that a software
                        package's license must meet in order to be included in
                        Debian. Because the Debian Project spent a good deal of
                        time thinking about how to construct such a test, the
                        guidelines they came up with have proven very robust
                        (see <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG" target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG</a>),
                        and as far as I'm aware, no serious objection to them has
                        been raised either by the Free Software Foundation or
                        the Open Source Initiative. If you know that a given
                        license is DFSG-compliant, you know that it guarantees
                        all the important freedoms (such as forkability even
                        against the original author's wishes) required to
                        sustain the dynamics of an open source project. Since
                        2004, the Debian Project has maintained a list of known
                        DFSG-compliant licenses at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses"

                        another widely-used test of whether a license permits
                        all the necessary freedoms. The OSI's definition of
                        open source software is based on the Debian Free
                        Software Guidelines, and any license that meets one
                        definition almost always meets the other. There have
                        been a few exceptions over the years, but only involving
                        niche licenses and none of any relevance here. The OSI
                        maintains a list of all
                        licenses it has ever approved, at
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/" target="_top">opensource.org/licenses/</a>,
                        so
                        that being "OSI-approved" is an unambiguous state: a
                        license either is or isn't on the list.</p>

                        <p>The Free Software Foundation also maintains a list
                            of licenses at <a class="ulink"

                            The FSF categorizes licenses not only by whether they

                        distributed at no charge can still be proprietary, if
                        its license does not permit free redistribution and
                        modification.</p>

                        <p>Generally "proprietary" and "closed-source" are
                            synonyms. However, "closed-source" additionally implies
                            that the source code cannot even be seen. Since the
                            source code cannot be seen with most proprietary
                            software, this is normally a distinction without a
                            difference. However, occasionally someone releases
                            proprietary software under a license that allows others
                            to view the source code. Confusingly, they sometimes
                            call this "open source" or "nearly open source," etc.,
                            but that's misleading. The
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>visibility</em></span> of the source code is
                            not the issue; the important question is what you're
                            allowed to do with it: if you can't copy, modify, and
                            redistribute, then it's not open source. Thus, the
                            difference between proprietary and closed-source is
                            mostly irrelevant; generally, the two can be treated
                            as synonyms.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes <em class="firstterm">commercial</em> is
                            used as a synonym for "proprietary," but this is
                            carelessness: the two are not the same. Free software
                            is always commercial software. After all, free software
                            can be sold, as long as the buyers are not restricted
                            from giving away copies themselves. It can be
                            commercialized in other ways as well, for example by
                            selling support, services, and certification. There are
                            billion-dollar companies built on free software
                            today, so it is clearly neither inherently
                            anti-commercial nor anti-corporate. It is merely
                            anti-proprietary, or if you prefer anti-monopolistic,
                            and this is the key way in which it differs from
                            per-copy license models.</p></dd>

                        having no author. Everything has an author, and even if a
                        work's author or authors choose to put it in the public
                        domain, that doesn't change the fact that they wrote
                        it.</p>

                        <p>When a work is in the public domain, material from
                            it can be incorporated into a copyrighted work, and the
                            derivative is thus under the same overall copyright as
                            the original copyrighted work. But this does not affect
                            the availability of the original public domain wok.
                            Thus, releasing something into the public domain is
                            technically one way to make it "free," according to the
                            guidelines of most free software certifying
                            organizations (see <a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.org/faq#public-domain"

                            However, there are usually good reasons to use a license
                            instead of just releasing into the public domain: even
                            with free software, certain terms and conditions can be
                            useful, not only to the copyright holder but to
                            recipients as well, as the next section makes clear.</p></dd>

                that anyone can modify the code, that anyone can redistribute it both
                in original and modified form, and that the copyright holders and

                especially important given that people might run modified versions
                without even knowing it). The differences between licences boil down

                        either license without violating the terms of the
                        other. The major exception to this is the GNU General
                        Public License, which requires that any work using GPLed
                        code be itself distributed under the GPL, and without
                        adding any further restrictions beyond what the GPL

                considerations in choosing the GPL or AGPL is the extent to which it
                is compatible with other licenses. For brevity, I'll refer just to
                the GPL below, but most of this applies to the AGPL as well.</p>

            <p>Because the primary goal of the GPL's authors is the promotion
                of free software, they deliberately crafted the license to make it
                impossible to mix GPLed code into proprietary programs. Specifically,
                among the GPL's requirements (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html"
                                                     target="_top">fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html</a> for its full
                text) are
                these two:</p>

            <div class="orderedlist">
                <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Any derivative workâthat is, any work
                        containing a nontrivial amount of GPLed codeâmust
                        itself be distributed under the GPL.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>No additional restrictions may be placed on the
                        redistribution of either the original work or a derivative
                        work. (The exact language is: "You may not impose any
                        further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
                        or affirmed under this License.")</p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>With these conditions, the GPL succeeds in making freedom
                contagious. Once a program is copyrighted under the GPL, its terms of
                redistribution are
                <em class="firstterm">reciprocal</em><sup>[<a name="idp9834112" href="#ftn.idp9834112" class="footnote">68</a>]</sup>âthey
                are passed
                on to anything else the code gets incorporated into, making it
                effectively impossible to use GPLed code in closed-source programs.
                However, these same clauses also make the GPL incompatible with
                certain other free licenses. The usual way this happens is that the
                other license imposes a requirementâfor example, a credit clause
                requiring the original authors to be mentioned in some wayâthat
                is incompatible with the GPL's "You may not impose any further
                restrictions..." language. From the point of view of the Free
                Software Foundation, these second-order consequences are desirable, or
                at least not regrettable. The GPL not only keeps your software free,
                but effectively makes your software an agent in pushing
                <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> software to enforce freedom as well.</p>

            <p>The question of whether or not this is a good way to
                promote free software is one of the most persistent holy wars on the
                Internet (see <a class="xref" href="#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">the section called âAvoid Holy
                    Warsâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6,
                    <i>Communications</i></a></span>), and we won't
                investigate it here. What's important for our purposes is that
                GPL compatibility is something to consider when choosing a license. The
                GPL is by far the most popular open source license, having more than
                twice as many projects released under it as under the next most
                popular licenses<sup>[<a name="idp9839136" href="#ftn.idp9839136" class="footnote">69</a>]</sup>.
                If you want your code to be able to be
                mixed freely with GPLed codeâand there's a lot of GPLed code out
                thereâthen you should pick a GPL-compatible license. Most of
                the GPL-compatible open source licenses are also
                proprietary-compatible: that is, code under such a license can be used
                in a GPLed program, and it can be used in a proprietary program. Of
                course, the <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span> of these mixings would not be
                compatible with each other, since one would be under the GPL and the
                other would be under a closed-source license. But that concern
                applies only to the derivative works, not to the code you distribute
                in the first place.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, the Free Software Foundation maintains a list
                showing which licenses are compatible with the GPL and which are not,
                at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html" target="_top">gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>.
                All
                of the licenses discussed in this chapter are present on that list, on
                one side or the other.</p></div>
        <div class="sect1" title="Choosing a License">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="license-choosing"></a>Choosing a License</h2>

            <p>When choosing a license to apply to your project, use an
                existing license instead of making up a new one. And don't just use
                any existing license&nbsp;â&nbsp;use one of the widely-used,
                well-recognized existing licenses.</p>

            <p>Such licenses are familiar to many people already. If you use
                one of them, people won't feel they have to read the legalese in order
                to use your code, because they'll have already done so for that
                license a long time ago. Thus, you reduce or remove one possible
                barrier to entry for your project. They are also of a high quality:
                they are the products of much thought and experience; indeed most
                of them are revisions of previous versions of themselves, and the
                modern versions represent a great deal of accumulated legal and
                technical wisdom. Unless your project has truly unusual needs, it is
                unlikely you could do better, even with a team of lawyers at your
                disposal.</p>

            <p>Below is a list of licenses that in my opinion meets these
                criteria; in parentheses are the standard formal abbreviation for the
                license and an authoritative URL for its full text. This list is not
                in order of preference, but rather in roughly descending order from
                strong copyleft at the top to completely non-copyleft at the bottom.
                The exact provisions of each license differ in various interesting
                ways (except for MIT and BSD, which differ only in uninteresting
                ways), and there isn't space here to explore all the possible
                ramifications of each for your project. However, many good
                discussions of that sort are available on the Internet; in particular
                the Wikipedia pages for these licenses generally give good
                overviews.</p>

            <p>If you have nothing else to guide you and you want a copyleft
                license, then choose either the GPL-3.0 or the
                AGPL-3.0&nbsp;â&nbsp;the difference between them will be
                discussed below&nbsp;â&nbsp;and if you want a non-copyleft
                license, choose the MIT license. I've put those licenses in boldface
                to reflect this:</p>

            <p>Note that there are some arguments for choosing the Apache
                License 2.0 as a default non-copyleft license, and they are nearly as
                compelling as those for choosing MIT. In the end, I come down in
                favor of MIT because it is extremely short, and both widely used and
                widely recognized<sup>[<a name="idp9864752" href="#ftn.idp9864752" class="footnote">70</a>]</sup>. While
                the
                Apache License 2.0 has the advantage of containing some explicit
                defenses against misuse of software patents, which might be important
                to your organization depending on the kind of project you're
                launching, the MIT license is fully compatible with all versions of
                the GNU General Public License, meaning that you can distributed,
                under any version of the GPL, mixed-provenance works that contain
                MIT-licensed code. The GPL-compatibility situation for the Apache
                License, on the other hand, is more complicated&nbsp;â&nbsp;by
                some interpretations, it is compatible with GPL version 3 only.
                Therefore, to avoid giving your downstream redistributors the headache
                of having to read sentences like the preceding ones, I just recommend
                the MIT license as the default non-copyleft license for anyone who
                doesn't have a reason to choose otherwise.</p>

                <p>If you prefer that your project's code not be used in

                    can be used in proprietary programs, the GNU General Public License is
                    a good choice.</p>

                <p>When writing a code library that is meant mainly to be used as
                    part of other programs, consider carefully whether the restrictions
                    imposed by the GPL are in line with your project's goals. In some
                    casesâfor example, when you're trying to unseat a competing,
                    proprietary library that offers the same functionalityâit may
                    make more strategic sense to license your code in such a way that it
                    can be mixed into proprietary programs, even though you would
                    otherwise not wish this. The Free Software Foundation even fashioned
                    an alternative to the GPL for such circumstances: the <em class="firstterm">GNU

                    The LGPL has looser restrictions than the GPL,
                    and can be mixed more easily with non-free code. The FSF's page about
                    the LGPL, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_top">gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a>,

                    <p>Whether you want to offer that option depends largely on how
                        likely you think the Free Software Foundation is to make GPL revisions
                        that you would approve of. I think the FSF has done a good job of
                        that so far, and I generally do include that option when I use the
                        GPL. That way I don't have to be responsible for updating the
                        licenses myself forever&nbsp;â&nbsp;which is good, since I won't
                        be around forever. Others can do it, either just to keep the software
                        license up-to-date with legal developments, or to solve some future
                        license compatibility problem that couldn't have been anticipated now
                        (for example, see the compatibility discussion in <a class="xref" href="#gnu-affero-gpl"
                                                                             title="The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code">the

                    <p>Not everyone feels the same way, however; most notably, the
                        Linux kernel is famously licensed under the GNU GPL version 2
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> the "or any later version" clause, and
                        influential kernel copyright holders, especially Linus Torvalds, have
                        expressed clearly that they do not intend to move its license to
                        version 3.0.</p>

                    <p>In 2007, the Free Software Foundation released a variant of the
                        GPL called the <em class="firstterm">GNU Affero GPL</em><sup>[<a name="idp9885936"
                                                                                         href="#ftn.idp9885936"

                        Its purpose is to bring
                        copyleft-style sharing provisions to the increasing amount of code
                        being run as hosted services&nbsp;â&nbsp;that is, software that
                        runs "in the cloud" on remote servers, that users interact with only
                        over the network, and that therefore is never directly distributed to
                        users as executable or source code. Many such services use GPL'd
                        software, often with extensive modifications, yet could avoid
                        publishing their changes because they weren't actually distributing
                        code.</p>

                    <p>The AGPL's solution to this was to take the GPL and add a
                        "Remote Network Interaction" clause, stating "<span class="emphasis"><em>...if you
                            modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all
                            users interacting with it remotely through a computer network ... an
                            opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version ... at
                            no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
                            copying of software.</em></span>" This expanded the GPL's enforcement
                        powers into the new world of application service providers. The Free
                        Software Foundation recommends that the GNU AGPL 3.0 be used for any
                        software that will commonly be run over a network.</p>

                    <p>Note that the AGPL-3.0 is not directly compatible with GPL-2.0,
                        though it is compatible with GPL-3.0. Since most software licensed
                        under GPL-2.0 includes the "or any later version" clause anyway, that
                        software can just be shifted to GPL-3.0 if and when you need to mix it
                        with AGPL-3.0 code. However, if you need to mix with programs
                        licensed strictly under the GPL-2.0 (that is, programs licensed
                        without the "or any later version" clause), the AGPL3.0 wouldn't be
                        compatible with that.</p>

                    <p>Although the history of the AGPL-3.0 is a bit complicated, the
                        license itself is simple: it's just the GPL-3.0 with one extra clause
                        about network interaction. The Wikipedia article on the AGPL is
                        excellent: <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License"

                    </div>
                    <p>One consequence of choosing the GPL (or AGPL) is the
                        possibilityâsmall, but not infinitely smallâof finding
                        yourself or your project embroiled in a dispute about whether or not
                        the GPL is truly "free", given that it places some restrictions on
                        how you redistribute the codeânamely, the restriction that the
                        code cannot be distributed under any other license. For some people,
                        the existence of this restriction means the GPL is therefore "less
                        free" than non-copyleft licenses. Where this
                        argument usually goes, of course, is that since "more free" must be
                        better than "less free" (after all, who's not in favor of freedom?),
                        it follows that those licenses are better than the GPL.</p>

                    <p>This debate is another popular holy war (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">the section called âAvoid Holy
                            Warsâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>).
                        Avoid participating
                        in it, at least in project forums. Don't attempt to prove that the
                        GPL is less free, as free, or more free than other licenses. Instead,
                        emphasize the specific reasons your project chose the GPL. If the
                        recognizability of license was a reason, say that. If the enforcement
                        of a free license on derivative works was also a reason, say that too,
                        but refuse to be drawn into discussion about whether this makes the
                        code more or less "free". Freedom is a complex topic, and there is
                        little point talking about it if terminology is going to be used as a
                        stalking horse for substance.</p>

                    <p>Since this is a book and not a mailing list thread, however, I
                        will admit that I've never understood the "GPL is not free" argument.
                        The only restriction the GPL imposes is that it prevents people from
                        imposing <span class="emphasis"><em>further</em></span> restrictions. To say that this
                        results in less freedom has always seemed to me like saying that
                        outlawing slavery reduces freedom, because it prevents some people
                        from owning slaves.</p>

                    <p>(Oh, and if you do get drawn into a debate about it, don't raise
                        the stakes by making inflammatory analogies.)</p></div>

            <p>There are three ways to handle copyright ownership for free code
                and documentation that were contributed to by many people. The first
                is to ignore the issue of copyright entirely (I don't recommend this).
                The second is to collect a <em class="firstterm">contributor license
                    agreement</em> (<em class="firstterm">CLA</em>) from each person
                who works on the project, explicitly granting the project the right to
                use that person's contributions. This is usually enough for most
                projects, and the nice thing is that in some jurisdictions, CLAs can
                be sent in by email. The third way is to get actual
                <em class="firstterm">copyright assignment</em> (<em class="firstterm">CA</em>
                from contributors, so that the project (i.e., some legal entity,
                usually a nonprofit) is the copyright owner for everything. This way
                is the most burdensome for contributors, and some contributors simply
                refuse to do it; only a few projects still ask for assignment, and I don't
                recommend that any project require it these days.<sup>[<a name="idp9906704" href="#ftn.idp9906704"
                                                                          class="footnote">73</a>]</sup></p>

            <p>Note that even under centralized copyright ownership, the
                code<sup>[<a name="idp9907712" href="#ftn.idp9907712" class="footnote">74</a>]</sup> remains free,
                because
                open source licenses do not give the copyright holder the right to
                retroactively proprietize all copies of the code. So even if the
                project, as a legal entity, were to suddenly turn around and start
                distributing all the code under a restrictive license, that wouldn't
                cause a problem for the public community. The other developers would
                simply start a fork based on the latest free copy of the code, and
                continue as if nothing had happened.</p>

                <p>Most projects never collect CLAs or CAs from
                    their contributors. Instead, they accept code whenever it seems
                    reasonably clear that the contributor intended it to be incorporated
                    into the project.</p>

                <p>Under normal circumstances, this is okay. But every now and
                    then, someone may decide to sue for copyright infringement, alleging
                    that they are the true owner of the code in question and that they
                    never agreed to its being distributed by the project under an open
                    source license. For example, the SCO Group did something like this to
                    the Linux project, see
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies" target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies</a>
                    for details. When this happens, the project will have no
                    documentation showing that the contributor formally granted the right
                    to use the code, which could make some legal defenses more
                    difficult.</p></div>

                <p>CLAs probably offer the best tradeoff between safety and
                    convenience. A CLA is typically an electronic form that a developer
                    fills out and sends in to the project. In many jurisdictions, email
                    submission or an online form is enough. A secure digital signature
                    may or may not be required; consult a lawyer to find out what method
                    would be best for `your project.</p>

                <p>Most projects use two slightly different CLAs, one for
                    individuals, and one for corporate contributors. But in both types,
                    the core language is the same: the contributor grants the
                    project a <span class="emphasis"><em>"...perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                        royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
                        derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
                        and distribute [the] Contributions and such derivative
                        works."</em></span> Again, you should have a lawyer approve any CLA,
                    but if you get all those adjectives into it, you're off to a good start.</p>

                <p>When you request CLAs from contributors, make sure to emphasize
                    that you are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> asking for actual copyright
                    assignment. In fact, many CLAs start out by reminding the reader of
                    this:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This is a license agreement only; it

                        Relicensing Schemes</h2></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <a name="dual-licensing"></a>

            <p>Some companies offer open source code with a
                <em class="firstterm">proprietary relicensing</em>
                scheme<sup>[<a name="idp9931264" href="#ftn.idp9931264" class="footnote">75</a>]</sup>, in which an open
                source version of the
                software is available under the usual open source terms, while a
                proprietary version is available for a fee.</p>

            <p>Why would anyone want a proprietary version, when an open source
                version is already out there? There are two separate answers,
                reflecting the two different types of proprietary relicensing.</p>

            <p>The first kind is about <em class="firstterm">selling
                exceptions</em> to copyleft requirements, and is typically used
                with code libraries rather than with standalone applications. The way
                it works is that the library's owner (i.e., copyright holder), seeing
                that some of the library's users want to incorporate it into their own
                proprietary applications, sells them a promise to
                <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> enforce the redistribution requirements of
                the open source version's license. This only works when the open
                source code is under a copyleft-style license, of
                course&nbsp;â&nbsp;in practice it is usually the GPL or
                AGPL.</p>

            <p>With this promise in hand, the downstream users can use the
                library in their proprietary product without worry that they might be
                forced to share the source code to the full product under the copyleft
                license. One well-known example of "selling exceptions" is the MySQL
                database engine, which is distributed under the GPL version 2, but
                with a proprietary license offering available for many years, first
                from the Swedish company MySQL AB, and later from Oracle, Inc, which
                purchased MySQL AB in 2008.</p>

            <p>The second kind of proprietary relicensing, sometimes called the
                <em class="firstterm">freemium</em> model, uses an open source version to
                drive sales of a presumably fancier proprietary version. Usually the
                company offering the proprietary version is also the primary
                maintainer of the open source version, in the sense of supplying most
                of the developer attention (this is usually inevitable, for reasons
                we'll get to in a moment). Furthermore, although in theory the
                company <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> offer paid support for both the
                open source and proprietary versions, in practice they almost
                always offer it only for the proprietary version, because then they
                can charge two fees: a subscription fee for the software itself and a
                fee for the support services, with only the latter having any marginal
                cost to the supplier.</p>

            <p>You might be wondering: how can the copyright holder offer the
                software under a proprietary license if the terms of the GNU GPL
                stipulate that the code must be available under less restrictive
                terms? The answer is that the GPL's terms are something the copyright
                holder imposes on everyone else; the owner is therefore free to decide
                <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to apply those terms to itself. In other
                words, one always has the right to not sue one's self for copyright
                infringement. This right is not tied to the GPL or any other open
                source license; it is simply in the nature of copyright law.</p>

                            Relicensing</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Proprietary relicensing, of both varieties, tends to suffer from
                    several problems.</p>

                <p>First, it discourages the normal dynamics of open source
                    projects, because any code contributors from outside the company are
                    now effectively contributing to two distinct entities: the free
                    version of the code and the proprietary version. While the
                    contributor will be comfortable helping the free version, since that's
                    the norm in open source projects, she may feel less enthusiastic about
                    her contributions being useable in a monopolized proprietary product.
                    That is, unlike a straight non-copyleft license by which anyone has
                    the right to use the code as part of a proprietary work, here only
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> party has that right, and other participants
                    in the project are thus being asked to contribute to an asymmetric
                    result. This awkwardness is reflected and in some ways amplified by
                    the fact that in a proprietary relicensing scheme, the copyright owner
                    must collect some kind of formal agreement from each contributor (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#contributor-agreements" title="Contributor Agreements">the section called
                        âContributor Agreementsâ</a> earlier in this chapter), in
                    order to have the right to redistribute that contributor's code under
                    a proprietary license. Because such an agreement needs to give the
                    collecting entity special, one-sided rights that a typical open source
                    contributor agreement doesn't include, the process of collecting
                    agreements starkly confronts contributors with the imbalance of the
                    situation, and some of them may decline to sign. (Remember, they
                    don't need to sign a contribution agreement in order to distribute
                    their own changes along with the original code; rather, the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>company</em></span> needs the agreement in order to
                    redistribute the contributor's changes, especially under a proprietary
                    license. Asymmetry cuts both ways.)</p>

                <p>Historically, many companies that have started out offering a
                    seemingly clear proprietary relicensing option&nbsp;â&nbsp;use
                    our product under open source terms, or buy a proprietary license so
                    you can use it under proprietary terms&nbsp;â&nbsp;eventually
                    graduated to something closer to a "shakedown" model instead, in which
                    anyone who makes commercially significant use of the code ends up
                    being pressured to purchase a proprietary license as a way of
                    protecting their commercial revenue stream from harassment. The
                    precise legal bases on which this pressure rests differ from case to
                    case, but the overall pattern of behavior has been remarkably
                    consistent.</p>

                <p>Naturally, neither the companies initiating these shakedowns nor
                    the parties who are its targets, most of whom eventually capitulate,
                    have anything to gain from going on the record about it, so I can only
                    tell you that I have heard of it informally and off-the-record from
                    multiple developers, at different projects and different companies.
                    One reason I generally advise companies who are serious about open
                    source development to stay away from proprietary relicensing is that,
                    if history is a reliable guide, the temptation to undermine the open
                    source license will be overwhelming to the point of being impossible
                    to resist.</p>

                <p>Finally, there is a deep motivational problem for open source
                    projects that operate in the shadow of a proprietarily relicensed
                    version: the sense that most of the salaried development attention is
                    going to the proprietary version anyway, and that therefore spending
                    time contributing to the open source version is a fool's
                    game&nbsp;â&nbsp;that one is just helping a commercial entity
                    free up its own developers to work on features that the open source
                    community will never see. This fear is reasonable on its face, but it
                    also becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more outside developers
                    stay away, the company sees less reason to invest in the open source
                    code base, because they're not getting a community multiplier effect
                    anyway. Their disengagement in turn discourages outside developers,
                    and so on.</p>

                <p>What seems to happen in practice is that companies that offer
                    proprietarily relicensed software do not get truly active development
                    communities with external participants. They get occasional
                    small-scale bug fixes and cleanup patches from the outside, but end up
                    doing most of the hard work with internal resources. Since this book
                    is about running free software projects, I will just say that in my
                    experience, proprietary relicensing schemes inevitably have a negative
                    effect on the level of community engagement and the level of technical
                    quality on the open source side. If you conclude that for business
                    reasons you want to try it anyway, then I hope this section will at
                    least help you mitigate some of those effects.</p></div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Trademark law as applied to open source projects does not differ
                significantly from trademark law as applied elsewhere. This sometimes
                surprises people: they think that if the code can be copied freely,
                then that can't possibly be consistent with some entity controlling a
                trademark on the project's name or logo. It is consistent, however,
                and below I'll explain why, furnishing some examples.</p>

            <p>First, understand what trademarks are about: they are about
                truth in labeling and, to some degree, endorsement. A trademarked
                name or symbol is a way for an entity&nbsp;â&nbsp;the entity who
                owns or controls that trademark&nbsp;â&nbsp;to signal, in an
                easily recognizeable way, that they approve of a particular product.
                Often they are signaling their approval because they are the source of
                the product, and purchases of that product provide a revenue stream
                for them. But that is not the only circumstance under which someone
                might want to enforce accurate attribution. For example,
                certification marks are trademarked names or symbols that an entity
                applies to <span class="emphasis"><em>someone else's</em></span> product, in order to
                signal that the product meets the certifying entity's
                standards.</p>

            <p>Importantly, <span class="emphasis"><em>trademarks do not restrict copying,
                modification, or redistribution</em></span>. I cannot emphasize this
                enough: trademark is unrelated to copyright, and does not govern the
                same actions that copyright governs. Trademark is about what you may
                publicly call things, not about what you may do with those things nor
                with whom you may share them.</p>

            <p>One famous example of trademark enforcement in free and open
                source software demonstrates these distinctions clearly.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Case study: Mozilla Firefox, the Debian Project, and Iceweasel">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="mozilla-firefox-debian-iceweasel"></a>Case study: Mozilla
                            Firefox, the Debian Project, and Iceweasel</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The Mozilla Foundation owns the trademarked name "Firefox",
                    which it uses to refer to its popular free software web browser of the
                    same name. The Debian Project, which maintains a long-running and
                    also quite popular GNU/Linux distribution, wanted to package Firefox
                    for users of Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

                <p>So far, so good: Debian does not need Mozilla's permission to
                    package Firefox, since Firefox is open source software. However,
                    Debian does need Mozilla's permission to <span class="emphasis"><em>call</em></span> the
                    packaged browser "Firefox" and to use the widely-recognized Firefox
                    logo (you've probably seen it: a long reddish fox curling its body and
                    tail around a blue globe) as the icon for the program, because those
                    are trademarks owned by Mozilla.</p>

                <p>Normally, Mozilla would have happily given its permission.
                    After all, having Firefox distributed in Debian is good for Mozilla's
                    mission of promoting openness on the Web. However, various technical
                    and policy effects of the Debian packaging process left Debian unable
                    to fully comply with Mozilla's trademark usage requirements, and as a
                    result, Mozilla informed Debian that their Firefox package could not
                    use the Firefox name or branding. No doubt Mozilla did so with some
                    reluctance, as it is not ideal for them to have their software used
                    without clear attribution. However, they could have given Debian a
                    trademark license and yet chose not to; presumably, this is because
                    Debian was doing something with the code that Mozilla did not want
                    accruing to their own reputation.<sup>[<a name="idp9959536" href="#ftn.idp9959536" class="footnote">76</a>]</sup>
                </p>

                <p>This decision by Mozilla did not mean that Debian had to remove
                    Firefox from their package system, of course. Debian simply changed
                    the name to "Iceweasel" and used a different logo. The underlying
                    code is still the Mozilla Firefox code, except for the minor bits
                    Debian had to change to integrate the different name and
                    logo&nbsp;â&nbsp;changes they were perfectly free to make, of
                    course, because of the code's open source license.</p></div>
            <p>It is even consistent to license your project's logo artwork
                files under a fully free license while still retaining a trademark on
                the logo, as the following story of the GNOME logo and the fish
                pedicure shop (I'm not making this up) illustrates.</p>

                <p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://gnome.org/" target="_top">GNOME Project</a>, which
                    produces one of the major free software desktop environments, is
                    represented legally by the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnome.org/foundation/" target="_top">GNOME
                        Foundation</a>,
                    which owns and enforces trademarks on behalf of the project. Their
                    best-known trademark is the GNOME logo: a curved, stylized foot with
                    four toes floating close above it.<sup>[<a name="idp9966000" href="#ftn.idp9966000"
                                                               class="footnote">77</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>One day, Karen Sandler, then the Executive Director of the GNOME
                    Foundation, heard from a GNOME contributor that a mobile fish-pedicure
                    van (fish pedicure is a technique in which one places one's feet in
                    water so that small fish can nibble away dead skin) was using a
                    modified version of the GNOME logo. The central foot part of the
                    image had been slightly modified to look like a fish, and a fifth toe
                    had been added above, so that the overall logo looked even more like a
                    human foot but cleverly made reference to fish as well. You can see
                    it, along with discussion of other trademark issues GNOME has dealt
                    with, in the Linux Weekly News article where this story is told in
                    full: <a class="ulink" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/491639/"
                             target="_top">lwn.net/Articles/491639</a>.</p>

                <p>Although GNOME does actively enforce its trademarks, Sandler did
                    not see any infringement in this case: the fish-pedicure business is
                    so distant from what the GNOME Project does that there was no
                    possibility of confusion in the mind of the public or dilution (if
                    you'll pardon the expression) of the mark. Furthermore, because the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span> license on GNOME's images is an open
                    source license, the fish pedicure company was free to make their
                    modifications to the graphic and display the results. There was no
                    trademark violation, because there was no infringement within GNOME's
                    domain of activity, and there was no copyright violation, because
                    GNOME's materials are released under free licenses.</p></div>
            <p>The point of these examples is to merely show that there is no
                inherent contradiction in registering and maintaining trademarks
                related to open source projects. This does not mean that a trademark
                owner should do whatever they want with the marks, ignoring what other
                participants in the project have to say. Trademarks are like any
                other centrally-controlled resource: if you use them in a way that
                harms a significant portion of the project's community, then expect
                complaints and pushback in return; if you use them in a way that
                supports the goals of the project, then most participants will be glad
                and will consider that use to be itself a form of contribution.</p></div>

            <p>Software patents have long been a lightning rod issue in
                free software, because they pose the only real threat against which
                the free software community cannot defend itself. Copyright and
                trademark problems can always be gotten around. If part of your code
                looks like it may infringe on someone else's copyright, you can just
                rewrite that part while continuing to use the same underlying
                algorithm. If it turns out someone has a trademark on your
                project's name, at the very worst you can just rename the project.
                Although changing names would be a temporary inconvenience, it
                wouldn't matter in the long run, since the code itself would still do
                what it always did.</p>

            <p>But a patent is a blanket injunction against implementing a
                certain idea. It doesn't matter who writes the code, nor even what
                programming language is used. Once someone has accused a free
                software project of infringing a patent, the project must either stop
                implementing that particular feature, or expose the project
                <span class="emphasis"><em>and its users</em></span> to expensive and
                time-consuming lawsuits. Since the instigators of such lawsuits are
                usually corporations with deep pocketsâthat's who has the
                resources and inclination to acquire patents in the first
                placeâmost free software projects cannot afford either to defend
                themselves nor to indemnify their users, and must capitulate
                immediately even if they think it
                highly likely that the patent would be unenforceable in court. To
                avoid getting into such a situation in the first place, free software
                projects have sometimes had to code defensively, avoiding patented
                algorithms in advance even when they are the best or only available
                solution to a programming problem.</p>

            <p>Surveys and anecdotal evidence show that not only the vast
                majority of open source programmers, but a majority
                of <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> programmers, think that software patents
                should be abolished entirely.<sup>[<a name="idp9977936" href="#ftn.idp9977936" class="footnote">78</a>]</sup>
                Open source programmers tend to feel
                particularly strongly about it, and may refuse to work on projects
                that are too closely associated with the collection or enforcement of
                software patents. If your organization collects software patents,
                then make it clear, in a public and irrevocable way, that the patents
                would never be enforced when the infringement comes from open source
                code, and that the patents are
                only to be used as a defense in case some other party initiates an
                infringement suit against your organization. This is not only the
                right thing to do, it's also good open source public relations.<sup>[<a name="idp9979888"
                                                                                        href="#ftn.idp9979888"
                                                                                        class="footnote">79</a>]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, collecting patents purely for defensive purposes
                is rational. The current patent system, at least in the United
                States, is by its nature an arms race: if your competitors have
                acquired a lot of patents, then your best defense is to acquire a lot
                of patents yourself, so that if you're ever hit with a patent
                infringement suit you can respond with a similar threatâthen the
                two parties usually sit down and work out a cross-licensing deal so
                that neither of them has to pay anything, except to their patent
                lawyers of course.</p>

            <p>The harm done to free software by software patents is more
                insidious than just direct threats to code development, however.
                Software patents encourage an atmosphere of secrecy among firmware
                designers, who justifiably worry that by publishing details of their
                interfaces they will be making it easier for competitors to find ways
                to slap them with patent infringement suits. This is not just a
                theoretical danger; it has apparently been happening for a long time
                in the video card industry, for example. Many video card
                manufacturers are reluctant to release the detailed programming
                specifications needed to produce high-performance open source drivers
                for their cards, thus making it impossible for free operating systems
                to support those cards to their full potential. Why would the
                manufacturers withold these specs? It doesn't make sense for them to
                work <span class="emphasis"><em>against</em></span> software support; after all,
                compatibility with more operating systems can only mean more card
                sales. But it turns out that, behind the design room door, these
                shops are all violating one another's patents, sometimes knowingly and
                sometimes accidentally. The patents are so unpredictable and so
                potentially broad that no card manufacturer can ever be certain it's
                safe, even after doing a patent search. Thus, manufacturers dare not
                publish their full interface specifications, since that would make it
                much easier for competitors to figure out whether any patents are
                being infringed. (Of course, the nature of this situation is such
                that you will not find a written admission from a primary source that
                it is going on; I learned it through a personal communication.)</p>

            <p>Modern free software licenses generally have clauses to combat,
                or at least mitigate, the dangers arising from software patents.
                Usually these clauses work by automatically revoking the overall open
                source license for any party who makes a patent infringement claim
                based on either the work as a whole<sup>[<a name="idp9985504" href="#ftn.idp9985504"
                                                            class="footnote">80</a>]</sup>,
                or based on the claimant's code contributions to the project. But
                though it is useful, both legally and politically, to build patent
                defenses into free software licenses in this way, in the end these
                protections are not be enough to dispel the chilling effect that the
                threat of patent lawsuits has on free software. Only changes in the
                substance or interpretation of international patent law will do
                that.</p>

            <p>Recent developments, such as the 2014 decision by the
                U.S. Supreme Court against the patentability of abstract ideas, in
                <em class="citetitle">Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank</em> (<a class="ulink"

                have made the future of software patents unpredictable. But there is
                so much money to be extracted via infringement claims, in particular
                by <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll" target="_top">patent
                    trolls</a> but in general by any entity with a large patent
                portfolio and a lack of other revenue sources, that I am not
                optimistic this fight will be over any time soon. If you want to

                about six years since the main posts there were published, but all the
                reasons why software patents are a bad idea are just as true now as
                they were then.</p></div>

                The history of the license and its name is a bit complicated. The
                first version of the license was originally released by Affero, Inc,
                who based it on the GNU GPL version 2. At the time, this was commonly
                referred to as the AGPL. Later, the Free Software Foundation decided
                to adopt the idea, but by then they had released version 3 of their
                GNU GPL, so they based their new Affero-ized license on that and
                called it the "GNU AGPL". The old Affero license is now rarely used
                and is more or less deprecated, but to avoid ambiguity, say "AGPL-3.0"
                or "GNU AGPL" to make it clear that you're referring to the modern GNU
                version of the license.</p></div>
            <div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp9906704" href="#idp9906704" class="para">73</a>] </sup>Also,
                actual copyright transferral is subject to national law, and licenses
                designed for the United States may encounter problems elsewhere (e.g.,
                in Germany, where it's apparently not possible to transfer
                copyright).</p></div>

            <div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp9931264" href="#idp9931264" class="para">75</a>] </sup>This is
                sometimes also called <em class="firstterm">dual
                    licensing</em>, but that term is ambiguous, as it has
                historically also referred to releasing open source software under two
                or more open source licenses simultaneously. I am grateful to Bradley
                Kuhn for pointing out this ambiguity and suggesting the more accurate
                term.</p></div>

                that was
                indeed the reason, though we do not need to go into the details here
                of exactly what changes Debian makes to the Firefox code that Mozilla
                disagrees with strongly enough to want to dissociate their name from

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of
      this License.

   c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
      listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
      been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially
      equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because
      that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose,
      meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
      (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works
      made available under that license under this License or a
      Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License
      Elements as this License.

   g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
      created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
      identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
      performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
      persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
      otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of
      folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
      person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
      broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

   h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or

      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
      literary or artistic work.

            <p>At parties, people no longer give me a blank stare when I tell
                them I write free software. "Oh, yes, open sourceâlike Linux?"
                they say. I nod eagerly in agreement. "Yes, exactly! That's what I
                do." It's nice not to be completely fringe anymore. In the past, the
                next question was usually fairly predictable: "How do you make money
                doing that?" To answer, I'd summarize the economics of open source:
                that there are organizations in whose interest it is to have certain
                software exist, but that they don't need to sell copies, they just
                want to make sure the software is available and maintained, as a tool
                instead of as a commodity.</p>

            <p>The next question is not always about money, though. The
                business case for open source software<sup>[<a name="idp51392" href="#ftn.idp51392"
                                                               class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> is no longer so
                mysterious, and even non-programmers already understandâor at
                least are not surprisedâthat there are people employed at it
                full time. Instead, the next question is often "<span class="emphasis"><em>Oh, how
                    does that work?</em></span>"</p>

            <p>I didn't have a satisfactory answer ready, and the harder I
                tried to come up with one, the more I realized how complex a topic it
                really is. Running a free software project is not exactly like
                running a business (imagine having to constantly negotiate the nature
                of your product with a group of volunteers, most of whom you've never
                met!). Nor, for various reasons, is it exactly like running a
                traditional non-profit organization, nor a government. It has
                similarities to all these things, but I have slowly come to the
                conclusion that free software is <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">sui
                    generis</em></span>. There are many things with which it can be
                usefully compared, but none with which it can be equated. Indeed,
                even the assumption that free software projects can be "run" is a
                stretch. A free software project can be <span class="emphasis"><em>started</em></span>,
                and it can be influenced by interested parties, often quite strongly.
                But its assets cannot be made the property of any single owner, and as
                long as there are people somewhereâanywhereâinterested in
                continuing it, it cannot be unilaterally shut down. Everyone has
                infinite power; everyone has no power. It's an interesting
                dynamic.</p>

            <p>That is why I wanted to write this book in the first place, and
                seven years later, wanted to update it. Free software projects have
                evolved a distinct culture, an ethos in which the liberty to make the
                software do anything one wants is a central tenet. Yet the result of
                this liberty is not a scattering of individuals each going their own
                separate way with the code, but enthusiastic collaboration. Indeed,
                competence at cooperation itself is one of the most highly valued
                skills in free software. To manage these projects is to engage in a
                kind of hypertrophied cooperation, where one's ability not only to
                work with others but to come up with new ways of working together can
                result in tangible benefits to the software. This book attempts to
                describe the techniques by which this may be done. It is by no means
                complete, but it is at least a beginning.</p>

            <p>Good free software is a worthy goal in itself, and I hope that
                readers who come looking for ways to achieve it will be satisfied with
                what they find here. But beyond that I also hope to convey something
                of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of
                open source developers, and from interacting with users in the
                wonderfully direct way that open source encourages. Participating in
                a successful free software project is a deep pleasure, and ultimately
                that's what keeps the whole system going.</p></div>

            <p>This book is meant for software developers and managers who are
                considering starting an open source project, or who have started one
                and are wondering what to do now. It should also be helpful for
                people who just want to participate in an open source project but have
                never done so before.</p>

            <p>The reader need not be a programmer, but should know basic
                software engineering concepts such as APIs, source code, compilers, and
                patches.</p>

            <p>Prior experience with open source software, as either a user or
                a developer, is not necessary. Those who have worked in free software
                projects before will probably find at least some parts of the book a
                bit obvious, and may want to skip those sections. Because there's
                such a potentially wide range of audience experience, I've made an
                effort to label sections clearly, and to say when something can be
                skipped by those already familiar with the material.</p></div>

            <p>Much of the raw material for the first edition of this book came
                from five years of working with the Subversion project (<a class="ulink"
                                                                           href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"
                                                                           target="_top">subversion.tigris.org</a>).
                Subversion is an open source
                version control system, written from scratch, and intended to replace
                CVS as the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> version control
                system of choice in the open source community. The project was
                started by my employer, CollabNet (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_top">collab.net</a>),
                in early 2000,
                and thank goodness
                CollabNet understood right from the start how to run it as a truly
                collaborative, distributed effort. We got a lot of volunteer
                developer buy-in early on; today there are 50-some developers on the
                project, of whom only a few are CollabNet employees.</p>

            <p>Subversion is in many ways a classic example of an open source
                project, and I ended up drawing on it more heavily than I originally
                expected. This was partly a matter of convenience: whenever I needed
                an example of a particular phenomenon, I could usually call one up
                from Subversion right off the top of my head. But it was also a
                matter of verification. Although I am involved in other free software
                projects to varying degrees, and talk to friends and acquaintances
                involved in many more, one quickly realizes when writing for print
                that all assertions need to be fact-checked. I didn't want to make
                statements about events in other projects based only on what I could
                read in their public mailing list archives. If someone were to try
                that with Subversion, I knew, she'd be right about half the time and
                wrong the other half. So when drawing inspiration or examples from a
                project with which I didn't have direct experience, I tried to first
                talk to an informant there, someone I could trust to explain what was
                really going on.</p>

            <p>While Subversion was my full time job from 2000-2006, I've been
                involved in free software for more than twenty years, including the
                seven years since 2006 (when the first edition of this book was
                published). Other projects and organizations that have influenced
                this book include:</p>

            <p>This book took four times longer to write than I thought it
                would, and for much of that time felt rather like a grand piano
                suspended above my head wherever I went. Without help from many
                people, I would not have been able to complete it while staying
                sane.</p>

            <p>Andy Oram, my editor at O'Reilly, was a writer's dream. Aside
                from knowing the field intimately (he suggested many of the topics),
                he has the rare gift of knowing what one meant to say and helping one
                find the right way to say it. It has been an honor to work with him.
                Thanks also to Chuck Toporek for steering this proposal to Andy right
                away.</p>

            <p>Brian Fitzpatrick reviewed almost all of the material as I wrote
                it, which not only made the book better, but kept me writing when I
                wanted to be anywhere in the world but in front of the computer. Ben
                Collins-Sussman and Mike Pilato also checked up on progress, and were
                always happy to discussâsometimes at lengthâwhatever topic
                I was trying to cover that week. They also noticed when I slowed
                down, and gently nagged when necessary. Thanks, guys.</p>

            <p>Biella Coleman was writing her dissertation at the same time
                I was writing this book. She knows what it means to sit down and
                write every day, and provided an inspiring example as well as a
                sympathetic ear. She also has a fascinating anthropologist's-eye view
                of the free software movement, giving both ideas and references that I
                was able use in the book. Alex Golubâanother anthropologist
                with one foot in the free software world, and also finishing his
                dissertation at the same timeâwas exceptionally supportive early
                on, which helped a great deal.</p>

            <p>Micah Anderson somehow never seemed too oppressed by his own
                writing gig, which was inspiring in a sick, envy-generating sort of
                way, but he was ever ready with friendship, conversation, and (on at
                least one occasion) technical support. Thanks, Micah!</p>

            <p>Jon Trowbridge and Sander Striker gave both encouragement and
                concrete helpâtheir broad experience in free software provided
                material I couldn't have gotten any other way.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Greg Stein not only for friendship and well-timed
                encouragement, but for showing the Subversion project how important
                regular code review is in building a programming community. Thanks
                also to Brian Behlendorf, who tactfully drummed into our heads the
                importance of having discussions publicly; I hope that principle is
                reflected throughout this book.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Benjamin "Mako" Hill and Seth Schoen, for various
                conversations about free software and its politics; to Zack Urlocker
                and Louis Suarez-Potts for taking time out of their busy schedules to
                be interviewed; to Shane on the Slashcode list for allowing his post
                to be quoted; and to Haggen So for his enormously helpful comparison
                of canned hosting sites.</p>

            <p>Thanks to Alla Dekhtyar, Polina, and Sonya for their unflagging
                and patient encouragement. I'm very glad that I will no longer have
                to end (or rather, try unsuccessfully to end) our evenings early to go
                home and work on "The Book."</p>

            <p>Thanks to Jack Repenning for friendship, conversation, and a
                stubborn refusal to ever accept an easy wrong analysis when a harder
                right one is available. I hope that some of his long experience with
                both software development and the software industry rubbed off on this
                book.</p>

            <p>CollabNet was exceptionally generous in allowing me a flexible
                schedule to write, and didn't complain when it went on far longer than
                originally planned. I don't know all the intricacies of how
                management arrives at such decisions, but I suspect Sandhya Klute, and
                later Mahesh Murthy, had something to do with itâmy thanks to
                them both.</p>

            <p>The entire Subversion development team has been an inspiration
                for the past five years, and much of what is in this book I learned
                from working with them. I won't thank them all by name here, because
                there are too many, but I implore any reader who runs into a
                Subversion committer to immediately buy that committer the drink of
                his choiceâI certainly plan to.</p>

            <p>Many times I ranted to Rachel Scollon about the state of the
                book; she was always willing to listen, and somehow managed to make
                the problems seem smaller than before we talked. That helped a
                lotâthanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks (again) to Noel Taylor, who must surely have wondered why
                I wanted to write another book given how much I complained the last
                time, but whose friendship and leadership of GolosÃ¡ helped keep
                music and good fellowship in my life even in the busiest times.
                Thanks also to Matthew Dean and Dorothea Samtleben, friends and
                long-suffering musical partners, who were very understanding as my
                excuses for not practicing piled up. Megan Jennings was constantly
                supportive, and genuinely interested in the topic even though it was
                unfamiliar to herâa great tonic for an insecure writer. Thanks,
                pal!</p>

            <p>I had four knowledgeable and diligent reviewers for this book:
                Yoav Shapira, Andrew Stellman, Davanum Srinivas, and Ben Hyde. If I
                had been able to incorporate all of their excellent suggestions, this
                would be a better book. As it was, time constraints forced me to pick
                and choose, but the improvements were still significant. Any errors
                that remain are entirely my own.</p>

            <p>My parents, Frances and Henry, were wonderfully supportive as
                always, and as this book is less technical than the previous one, I
                hope they'll find it somewhat more readable.</p>

            <p>Finally, I would like to thank the dedicatees, Karen Underhill
                and Jim Blandy. Karen's friendship and understanding have meant
                everything to me, not only during the writing of this book but for the
                last seven years. I simply would not have finished without her help.
                Likewise for Jim, a true friend and a hacker's hacker, who first
                taught me about free software, much as a bird might teach an airplane
                about flying.</p></div>

            <p>Most free software projects fail.</p>

            <p>We tend not to hear very much about the failures. Only
                successful projects attract attention, and there are so many free
                software projects in total<sup>[<a name="idp5137984" href="#ftn.idp5137984"
                                                   class="footnote">2</a>]</sup> that even though only a small
                percentage
                succeed, the result is still a lot of visible projects. We also don't
                hear about the failures because failure is not an event. There is no
                single moment when a project ceases to be viable; people just sort of
                drift away and stop working on it. There may be a moment when a final
                change is made to the project, but those who made it usually didn't
                know at the time that it was the last one. There is not even a clear
                definition of when a project is expired. Is it when it hasn't been
                actively worked on for six months? When its user base stops growing,
                without having exceeded the developer base? What if the developers of
                one project abandon it because they realized they were duplicating the
                work of anotherâand what if they join that other project, then
                expand it to include much of their earlier effort? Did the first
                project end, or just change homes?</p>

            <p>Because of such complexities, it's impossible to put a precise
                number on the failure rate. But anecdotal evidence from two decades
                in open source, some casting around on multi-project hosting sites
                (see <a class="xref" href="#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the section called âCanned
                    Hostingâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span> for more about
                them), and a little Googling all point to the same conclusion: the
                rate is extremely high, probably on the order of 90â95%. The
                number climbs higher if you include surviving but dysfunctional
                projects: those which <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> producing running code,
                but which are not pleasant places to be, or are not making progress as
                quickly or as dependably as they could.</p>

            <p>This book is about avoiding failure. It examines not only how
                to do things right, but how to do them wrong, so you can recognize and
                correct problems early. My hope is that after reading it, you will
                have a repertory of techniques not just for avoiding common pitfalls
                of open source development, but also for dealing with the growth and
                maintenance of a successful project. Success is not a zero-sum game,
                and this book is not about winning or getting ahead of the
                competition. Indeed, an important part of running an open source
                project is working smoothly with other, related projects. In the long
                run, every successful project contributes to the well-being of the
                overall, worldwide body of free software.</p>

            <p>It would be tempting to say that free software projects fail for
                the same sorts of reasons proprietary software projects do.
                Certainly, free software has no monopoly on unrealistic requirements,
                vague specifications, poor resource management, insufficient design
                phases, or any of the other hobgoblins already well known to the
                software industry. There is a huge body of writing on these topics,
                and I will try not to duplicate it in this book. Instead, I will
                attempt to describe the problems peculiar to free software. When a
                free software project runs aground, it is often because the developers
                (or the managers) did not appreciate the unique problems of open
                source software development, even though they might be quite
                well-prepared for the better-known difficulties of closed-source
                development.</p>

            <p>One of the most common mistakes is unrealistic expectations
                about the benefits of open source itself. An open license does not
                guarantee that hordes of active developers will suddenly volunteer
                their time to your project, nor does open-sourcing a troubled project
                automatically cure its ills. In fact, quite the opposite: opening up
                a project can add whole new sets of complexities, and cost
                <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> in the short term than simply keeping it
                in-house. Opening up means arranging the code to be comprehensible to
                complete strangers, setting up development documentation and email lists,
                and often writing documentation for the first time. All this is a lot
                of work. And of course, if any interested developers
                <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> show up, there is the added burden of
                answering their questions for a while before seeing any benefit from
                their presence. As developer Jamie Zawinski said about the troubled
                early days of the Mozilla project:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">

                    you can't take a dying project, sprinkle it with the magic pixie
                    dust of "open source," and have everything magically work

            <p>A related mistake is that of skimping on presentation and
                packaging, figuring that these can always be done later, when the
                project is well under way. Presentation and packaging comprise a wide
                range of tasks, all revolving around the theme of reducing the barrier
                to entry. Making the project inviting to the uninitiated means
                writing user and developer documentation, setting up docs that are
                informative to newcomers, automating as much of the
                software's compilation and installation as possible, etc.</p>

            <p>Many programmers unfortunately treat this kind of work as being
                of secondary importance to the code itself. There are a couple of
                reasons for this. First, it can feel like busywork, because its
                benefits are most visible to those least familiar with the
                project&nbsp;â&nbsp;and vice versa: after all, the people who
                develop the code don't really need the packaging. They already know
                how to install, administer, and use the software, because they wrote
                it. Second, the skills required to do presentation and packaging well
                are often completely different from those required to write code.
                People tend to focus on what they're good at, even if it might serve
                the project better to spend a little time on something that suits them
                less. <a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2,
                    <i>Getting Started</i></a> discusses presentation and
                packaging in detail, and explains why it's crucial that they be a
                priority from the very start of the project.</p>

            <p>Next comes the fallacy that little or no project management is
                required in open source, or conversely, that the same management
                practices used for in-house development will work equally well on an
                open source project. Management in an open source project isn't
                always very visible, but in the successful projects, it's usually
                happening behind the scenes in some form or another. A small thought
                experiment suffices to show why. An open source project consists of a
                random collection of programmersâalready a notoriously
                independent-minded speciesâwho have most likely never met each
                other, and who may each have different personal goals in working on
                the project. The thought experiment is simply to imagine what would
                happen to such a group <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> management.
                Barring miracles, it would collapse or drift apart very quickly.
                Things won't simply run themselves, much as we might wish otherwise.
                But the management, though it may be quite active, is often informal,
                subtle, and low-key. The only thing keeping a development group
                together is their shared belief that they can do more in concert than
                individually. Thus the goal of management is mostly to ensure that
                they continue to believe this, by setting standards for
                communications, by making sure useful developers don't get
                marginalized due to personal idiosyncracies, and in general by making
                the project a place developers want to keep coming back to. Specific
                techniques for doing this are discussed throughout the rest of this
                book.</p>

            <p>Finally, there is a general category of problems that may be
                called "failures of cultural navigation." Twenty years ago, even ten,
                it would have been premature to talk about a global culture of free
                software, but not anymore. A recognizable culture has slowly emerged,
                and while it is certainly not monolithicâit is at least as prone
                to internal dissent and factionalism as any geographically bound
                cultureâit does have a basically consistent core. Most
                successful open source projects exhibit some or all of the
                characteristics of this core. They reward certain types of behaviors,
                and punish others; they create an atmosphere that encourages unplanned
                participation, sometimes at the expense of central coordination; they
                have concepts of rudeness and politeness that can differ substantially
                from those prevalent elsewhere. Most importantly, longtime
                participants have generally internalized these standards, so that they
                share a rough consensus about expected conduct. Unsuccessful projects
                usually deviate in significant ways from this core, albeit
                unintentionally, and often do not have a consensus about what
                constitutes reasonable default behavior. This means that when
                problems arise, the situation can quickly deteriorate, as the
                participants lack an already established stock of cultural reflexes to
                fall back on for resolving differences. </p>

            <p>That last category, failures of cultural navigation, includes an
                interesting phenomenon: certain types of organizations are
                structurally less compatible with open source development than others.
                One of the great surprises for me in preparing the second edition of
                this book was realizing that, on the whole, my experiences indicated
                that governments are less naturally suited to participating in free
                software projects than private-sector, for-profit corporations, with
                non-profits somewhere in between the two. There are many reasons for
                this (see <a class="xref" href="#governments-and-open-source" title="Governments and Open Source">the
                    section called âGovernments and Open Sourceâ</a>), and the
                problems are certainly surmountable, but it's worth noting that when
                an existing organization&nbsp;â&nbsp;particularly a hierarchical
                one, and <span class="emphasis"><em>particularly</em></span> a hierarchical,
                risk-averse, and publicity-sensitive one&nbsp;â&nbsp;starts or
                joins an open source project, some adjustments will usually be
                needed.</p>

            <p>This book is a practical guide, not an anthropological study or
                a history. However, a working knowledge of the origins of today's
                free software culture is an essential foundation for any practical
                advice. A person who understands the culture can travel far and wide
                in the open source world, encountering many local variations in custom
                and dialect, yet still be able to participate comfortably and
                effectively everywhere. In contrast, a person who does not understand
                the culture will find the process of organizing or participating in a
                project difficult and full of surprises. Since the number of people
                developing free software is still growing by leaps and bounds, there
                are many people in that latter categoryâthis is largely a
                culture of recent immigrants, and will continue to be so for some
                time. If you think you might be one of them, the next section
                provides background for discussions you'll encounter later, both in
                this book and on the Internet. (On the other hand, if you've been
                working with open source for a while, you may already know a lot of
                its history, so feel free to skip the next section.)</p></div>

            <p>Software sharing has been around as long as software itself. In
                the early days of computers, manufacturers felt that competitive
                advantages were to be had mainly in hardware innovation, and therefore
                didn't pay much attention to software as a business asset. Many of
                the customers for these early machines were scientists or technicians,
                who were able to modify and extend the software shipped with the
                machine themselves. Customers sometimes distributed their patches
                back not only to the manufacturer, but to other owners of similar
                machines. The manufacturers often tolerated and even encouraged this:
                in their eyes, improvements to the software, from whatever source,
                just made the hardware more attractive to other potential
                customers.</p>

            <p>Although this early period resembled today's free software
                culture in many ways, it differed in two crucial respects. First,
                there was as yet little standardization of hardwareâit was a
                time of flourishing innovation in computer design, but the diversity
                of computing architectures meant that everything was incompatible with
                everything else. Software written for one machine would
                generally not work on another; programmers tended to acquire
                expertise in a particular architecture or family of architectures
                (whereas today they would be more likely to acquire expertise in a
                programming language or family of languages, confident that their
                expertise will be transferable to whatever computing hardware they
                happen to find themselves working with). Because a person's expertise
                tended to be specific to one kind of computer, their accumulation of
                expertise had the effect of making that particular architecture
                computer more attractive to them and their colleagues. It was
                therefore in the manufacturer's interests for machine-specific code
                and knowledge to spread as widely as possible.</p>

            <p>Second, there was no widespread Internet. Though there were
                fewer legal restrictions on sharing than there are today, the
                technical restrictions were greater: the means of getting data from
                place to place were inconvenient and cumbersome, relatively speaking.
                There were some small, local networks, good for sharing information
                among employees at the same lab or company. But there remained
                barriers to overcome if one wanted to share with the world. These
                barriers <span class="emphasis"><em>were</em></span> overcome in many cases. Sometimes
                different groups made contact with each other independently, sending
                disks or tapes through land mail, and sometimes the manufacturers
                themselves served as central clearing houses for patches. It also
                helped that many of the early computer developers worked at
                universities, where publishing one's knowledge was expected. But the
                physical realities of data transmission meant there was always an
                impedance to sharing, an impedance proportional to the distance (real
                or organizational) that the software had to travel. Widespread,
                frictionless sharing, as we know it today, was not possible.</p>

                <p>As the industry matured, several interrelated changes occurred
                    simultaneously. The wild diversity of hardware designs gradually gave
                    way to a few clear winnersâwinners through superior technology,
                    superior marketing, or some combination of the two. At the same time,
                    and not entirely coincidentally, the development of so-called "high
                    level" programming languages meant that one could write a program
                    once, in one language, and have it automatically translated
                    ("compiled") to run on different kinds of computers. The implications
                    of this were not lost on the hardware manufacturers: a customer could
                    now undertake a major software engineering effort without necessarily
                    locking themselves into one particular computer architecture. When
                    this was combined with the gradual narrowing of performance
                    differences between various computers, as the less efficient designs
                    were weeded out, a manufacturer that treated its hardware as its only
                    asset could look forward to a future of declining profit margins. Raw
                    computing power was becoming a fungible good, while software was
                    becoming the differentiator. Selling software, or at least treating
                    it as an integral part of hardware sales, began to look like a good
                    strategy.</p>

                <p>This meant that manufacturers had to start enforcing the
                    copyrights on their code more strictly. If users simply continued to
                    share and modify code freely among themselves, they might
                    independently reimplement some of the improvements now being sold as
                    "added value" by the supplier. Worse, shared code could get into the
                    hands of competitors. The irony is that all this was happening around
                    the time the Internet was getting off the ground. So just when truly
                    unobstructed software sharing was finally becoming technically
                    possible, changes in the computer business made it economically
                    undesirable, at least from the point of view of any single company.
                    The suppliers clamped down, either denying users access to the code
                    that ran their machines, or insisting on non-disclosure agreements
                    that made effective sharing impossible.</p>

                    <p>As the world of unrestricted code swapping slowly faded away, a
                        counterreaction crystallized in the mind of at least one programmer.
                        Richard Stallman worked in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s and early '80s,
                        during what turned out to be a golden age and a golden location for
                        code sharing. The AI Lab had a strong "hacker
                        ethic",<sup>[<a name="idp5217136" href="#ftn.idp5217136" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> and
                        people were not only encouraged but
                        expected to share whatever improvements they made to the system. As
                        Stallman wrote later:</p>

                    <p>This Edenic community collapsed around Stallman shortly after
                        1980, when the changes that had been happening in the rest of the
                        industry finally caught up with the AI Lab. A startup company hired
                        away many of the Lab's programmers to work on an operating system
                        similar to what they had been working on at the Lab, only now under an
                        exclusive license. At the same time, the AI Lab acquired new
                        equipment that came with a proprietary operating system.</p>

                    <p>By some quirk of personality, he decided to resist the trend.
                        Instead of continuing to work at the now-decimated AI Lab, or taking a
                        job writing code at one of the new companies, where the results of his
                        work would be kept locked in a box, he resigned from the Lab and
                        started the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The
                        goal of GNU<sup>[<a name="idp5225264" href="#ftn.idp5225264" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup> was
                        to develop a completely free and open
                        computer operating system and body of application software, in which
                        users would never be prevented from hacking or from sharing their
                        modifications. He was, in essence, setting out to recreate what had
                        been destroyed at the AI Lab, but on a world-wide scale and without
                        the vulnerabilities that had made the AI Lab's culture susceptible to
                        disintegration.</p>

                    <p>In addition to working on the new operating system, Stallman
                        devised a copyright license whose terms guaranteed that his code would
                        be perpetually free. The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a clever
                        piece of legal judo: it says that the code may be copied and modified
                        without restriction, and that both copies and derivative works (i.e.,
                        modified versions) must be distributed under the same license as the
                        original, with no additional restrictions. In effect, it uses
                        copyright law to achieve an effect opposite to that of traditional
                        copyright: instead of limiting the software's distribution, it
                        prevents <span class="emphasis"><em>anyone</em></span>, even the author, from limiting
                        distribution. For Stallman, this was better than simply putting his
                        code into the public domain. If it were in the public domain, any
                        particular copy of it could be incorporated into a proprietary program
                        (as also sometimes happens to code under permissive open source
                        copyright licenses <sup>[<a name="idp5228032" href="#ftn.idp5228032"
                                                    class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>). While
                        such incorporation wouldn't in
                        any way diminish the original code's continued availability, it would
                        have meant that Stallman's efforts could benefit the
                        enemyâproprietary software. The GPL can be thought of as a form
                        of protectionism for free software, because it prevents non-free
                        software from taking full advantage of GPLed code. The GPL and its
                        relationship to other free software licenses are discussed in detail
                        in <a class="xref" href="#legal"

                    <p>With the help of many programmers, some of whom shared
                        Stallman's ideology and some of whom simply wanted to see a lot of
                        free code available, the GNU Project began releasing free replacements
                        for many of the most critical components of an operating system.
                        Because of the now-widespread standardization in computer hardware and
                        software, it was possible to use the GNU replacements on otherwise
                        non-free systems, and many people did. The GNU text editor (Emacs)
                        and C compiler (GCC) were particularly successful, gaining large and
                        loyal followings not on ideological grounds, but simply on their
                        technical merits. By about 1990, GNU had produced most of a free
                        operating system, except for the kernelâthe part that the
                        machine actually boots up, and that is responsible for managing memory,
                        disk, and other system resources.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, the GNU project had chosen a kernel design that
                        turned out to be harder to implement than expected. The ensuing delay
                        prevented the Free Software Foundation from making the first release
                        of an entirely free operating system. The final piece was put into
                        place instead by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student
                        who, with the help of volunteers around the world, had completed a
                        free kernel using a more conservative design. He named it Linux, and
                        when it was combined with the existing GNU programs and other free
                        software (especially the X Windows System), the result was a
                        completely free operating system. For the first time, you could boot
                        up your computer and do work without using any proprietary
                        software.<sup>[<a name="idp5231520" href="#ftn.idp5231520" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup></p>

                    <p>Much of the software on this new operating system was not
                        produced by the GNU project. In fact, GNU wasn't even the only group
                        working on producing a free operating system (for example, the code
                        that eventually became NetBSD and FreeBSD was already under
                        development by this time). The importance of the Free Software
                        Foundation was not only in the code they wrote, but in their political
                        rhetoric. By talking about free software as a cause instead of a
                        convenience, they made it difficult for
                        programmers <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have a political consciousness
                        about it. Even those who disagreed with the FSF had to engage the
                        issue, if only to stake out a different position. The FSF's
                        effectiveness as propagandists lay in tying their code to a message,
                        by means of the GPL and other texts. As their code spread widely,
                        that message spread as well.</p></div>

                    <p>There were many other things going on in the nascent free
                        software scene, however, and not all were as explictly ideological as
                        Stallman's GNU Project. One of the most important was
                        the <em class="firstterm">Berkeley Software Distribution</em>
                        (<em class="firstterm">BSD</em>), a gradual re-implementation of the Unix
                        operating systemâwhich up until the late 1970's had been a
                        loosely proprietary research project at AT&amp;Tâby programmers
                        at the University of California at Berkeley. The BSD group did not
                        make any overt political statements about the need for programmers to
                        band together and share with one another, but they
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>practiced</em></span> the idea with flair and
                        enthusiasm, by coordinating a massive distributed development effort
                        in which the Unix command-line utilities and code libraries, and
                        eventually the operating system kernel itself, were rewritten from
                        scratch mostly by volunteers. The BSD project became a prime example
                        of non-ideological free software development, and also served as a
                        training ground for many developers who would go on to remain active
                        in the open source world.</p>

                    <p>Another crucible of cooperative development was the <em class="firstterm">X
                        Window System</em>, a free, network-transparent graphical
                        computing environment, developed at MIT in the mid-1980's in
                        partnership with hardware vendors who had a common interest in being
                        able to offer their customers a windowing system. Far from opposing
                        proprietary software, the X license deliberately allowed proprietary
                        extensions on top of the free coreâeach member of the consortium
                        wanted the chance to enhance the default X distribution, and thereby
                        gain a competitive advantage over the other members. X
                        Windows<sup>[<a name="idp5231984" href="#ftn.idp5231984" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup> itself
                        was free
                        software, but mainly as a way to level the playing field between
                        competing business interests and increase standardization, not out of
                        some desire to end the
                        dominance of proprietary software. Yet another example, predating the
                        GNU project by a few years, was TeX, Donald Knuth's free,
                        publishing-quality typesetting system. He released it under terms
                        that allowed anyone to modify and distribute the code, but not to call
                        the result "TeX" unless it passed a very strict set of compatibility
                        tests (this is an example of the "trademark-protecting" class of free
                        licenses, discussed more in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
                                                       title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10,
                            <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a>). Knuth wasn't
                        taking a stand one way or the other on the question of
                        free-versus-proprietary software; he just needed a better typesetting
                        system in order to complete his
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> goalâa book on computer
                        programmingâand saw no reason not to release his system to the
                        world when done.</p></div>
                <p>Without listing every project and every license, it's safe to
                    say that by the late 1980's, there was a lot of free software
                    available under a wide variety of licenses. The diversity of licenses
                    reflected a corresponding diversity of motivations. Even some of the
                    programmers who chose the GNU GPL were much less ideologically driven
                    than the GNU project itself was. Although they enjoyed working on free
                    software, many developers did not consider proprietary software a
                    social evil. There were people who felt a moral impulse to rid the
                    world of "software hoarding" (Stallman's term for non-free software),
                    but others were motivated more by technical excitement, or by the
                    pleasure of working with like-minded collaborators, or even by a
                    simple human desire for glory. Yet by and large these disparate
                    motivations did not interact in destructive ways. This may be
                    because software, unlike other creative forms like prose or the visual
                    arts, must pass semi-objective tests in order to be considered
                    successful: it must run, and be reasonably free of bugs. This gives
                    all participants in a project a kind of automatic common ground, a
                    reason and a framework for working together without worrying too much
                    about qualifications or motivations beyond the technical.</p>

                <p>Developers had another reason to stick together as well: it
                    turned out that the free software world was producing some very
                    high-quality code. In some cases, it was demonstrably technically
                    superior to the nearest non-free alternative; in others, it was at
                    least comparable, and of course it always cost less. While only a few
                    people might have been motivated to run free software on strictly
                    philosophical grounds, a great many people were happy to run it
                    because it did a better job. And of those who used it, some
                    percentage were always willing to donate their time and skills to help
                    maintain and improve the software.</p>

                <p>This tendency to produce good code was certainly not universal,
                    but it was happening with increasing frequency in free software
                    projects around the world. Businesses that depended heavily on
                    software gradually began to take notice. Many of them discovered that
                    they were already using free software in day-to-day operations, and
                    simply hadn't known it (upper management isn't always aware of
                    everything the IT department does). Corporations began to take a more
                    active and public role in free software projects, contributing time
                    and equipment, and sometimes even directly funding the development of
                    free programs. Such investments could, in the best scenarios, repay
                    themselves many times over. The sponsor only pays a small number of
                    expert programmers to devote themselves to the project full time, but
                    reaps the benefits of <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone's</em></span> contributions,
                    including work from unpaid volunteers and from programmers being paid
                    by other corporations.</p></div>

                <p>As the corporate world gave more and more attention to free
                    software, programmers were faced with new issues of presentation. One
                    was the word "free" itself. On first hearing the term "free software"
                    many people mistakenly think it means just "zero-cost software." It's
                    true that all free software is zero-cost,<sup>[<a name="idp5251120" href="#ftn.idp5251120"
                                                                      class="footnote">8</a>]</sup>
                    but not all zero-cost software is free as in "freedom"âthat is,
                    the freedom to share and modify for any purpose. For example, during the
                    battle of the browsers in the 1990s, both Netscape and Microsoft gave
                    away their competing web browsers at no charge, in a scramble to gain
                    market share. Neither browser was free in the "free software" sense.
                    You couldn't get the source code, and even if you could, you didn't
                    have the right to modify or redistribute it.<sup>[<a name="idp5241200" href="#ftn.idp5241200"
                                                                         class="footnote">9</a>]</sup>
                    The only thing
                    you could do was download an executable and run it. The browsers were
                    no more free than shrink-wrapped software bought in a store; they
                    merely had a lower price.</p>

                <p>This confusion over the word "free" is due entirely to an
                    unfortunate ambiguity in the English language. Most other tongues
                    distinguish low prices from liberty (the distinction between
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>gratis</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>libre</em></span> is
                    immediately clear to speakers of Romance languages, for example). But
                    English's position as the de facto bridge language of the Internet
                    means that a problem with English is, to some degree, a problem for
                    everyone. The misunderstanding around the word "free" was so
                    prevalent that free software programmers eventually evolved a standard
                    formula in response: "It's <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> as in
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>freedom</em></span>âthink <span class="emphasis"><em>free
                        speech</em></span>, not <span class="emphasis"><em>free beer</em></span>." Still, having
                    to explain it over and over is tiring. Many programmers felt, with
                    some justification, that the ambiguous word "free" was hampering the
                    public's understanding of this software.</p>

                <p>But the problem went deeper than that. The word "free" carried
                    with it an inescapable moral connotation: if freedom was an end in
                    itself, it didn't matter whether free software also happened to
                    be better, or more profitable for certain businesses in certain
                    circumstances. Those were merely pleasant side effects of a motive
                    that was, at its root, neither technical nor mercantile, but moral.
                    Furthermore, the "free as in freedom" position forced a glaring
                    inconsistency on corporations who wanted to support particular free
                    programs in one aspect of their business, but continue marketing
                    proprietary software in others.</p>

                <p>These dilemmas came to a community that was already poised for
                    an identity crisis. The programmers who actually
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>write</em></span> free software have never been of one mind
                    about the overall goal, if any, of the free software movement. Even
                    to say that opinions run from one extreme to the other would be
                    misleading, in that it would falsely imply a linear range where there
                    is instead a multidimensional scattering. However, two broad
                    categories of belief can be distinguished, if we are willing to ignore
                    subtleties for the moment. One group takes Stallman's view, that the
                    freedom to share and modify is the most important thing, and that
                    therefore if you stop talking about freedom, you've left out the core
                    issue. Others feel that the software itself is the most important
                    argument in its favor, and are uncomfortable with proclaiming
                    proprietary software inherently bad. Some, but not all, free
                    software programmers believe that the author (or employer, in the case
                    of paid work)
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> have the right to control the terms of
                    distribution, and that no moral judgement need be attached to the
                    choice of particular terms. Others don't believe this.</p>

                <p>For a long time, these differences did not need to be carefully
                    examined or articulated, but free software's burgeoning success in the
                    business world made the issue unavoidable. In 1998, the term
                    <em class="firstterm">open&nbsp;source</em> was created as an alternative
                    to "free", by a coalition of programmers who eventually became The
                    Open Source Initiative (OSI).<sup>[<a name="idp5262144" href="#ftn.idp5262144"

                    not only that "free software" was potentially confusing, but that the
                    word "free" was just one symptom of a general problem: that the
                    movement needed a marketing program to pitch it to the corporate
                    world, and that talk of morals and the social benefits of sharing
                    would never fly in corporate boardrooms. In their own words at the

                <p>The tips of many icebergs of controversy are visible in that
                    text. It refers to "our convictions", but smartly avoids spelling out
                    exactly what those convictions are. For some, it might be the
                    conviction that code developed according to an open process will be
                    better code; for others, it might be the conviction that all
                    information should be shared. There's the use of the word "theft" to
                    refer (presumably) to illegal copyingâa usage that many object
                    to, on the grounds that it's not theft if the original possessor still
                    has the item afterwards. There's the tantalizing hint that the free
                    software movement might be mistakenly accused of anti-commercialism,
                    but it leaves carefully unexamined the question of whether such an
                    accusation would have any basis in fact.</p>

                <p>None of which is to say that the OSI's web site is inconsistent
                    or misleading. It's not. Rather, it is an example of exactly what
                    the OSI claims had been missing from the free software movement: good
                    marketing, where "good" means "viable in the business world." The
                    Open Source Initiative gave a lot of people exactly what they had been
                    looking forâa vocabulary for talking about free software as a
                    development methodology and business strategy, instead of as a moral
                    crusade.</p></div>
            <p>The appearance of the Open Source Initiative changed the
                landscape of free software. It formalized a dichotomy that had long
                been unnamed, and in doing so forced the movement to acknowledge that
                it had internal politics as well as external. The effect today is
                that both sides have had to find common ground, since most projects
                include programmers from both camps, as well as participants who don't
                fit any clear category. This doesn't mean people never talk about
                moral motivationsâlapses in the traditional "hacker ethic" are
                sometimes called out, for example. But it is rare for a free software
                / open source developer to openly question the basic motivations of
                others in a project. The contribution trumps the contributor. If
                someone writes good code, you don't ask them whether they do it for
                moral reasons, or because their employer paid them to, or because
                they're building up their rÃ©sumÃ©, or whatever. You evaluate
                the contribution on technical grounds, and respond on technical
                grounds. Even explicitly political organizations like the Debian
                project, whose goal is to offer a 100% free (that is, "free as in
                freedom") computing environment, are fairly relaxed about integrating
                with non-free code and cooperating with programmers who don't share
                exactly the same goals.</p></div>

            <p>When running a free software project, you won't need to talk
                about such weighty philosophical matters on a daily basis.
                Programmers will not insist that everyone else in the project agree
                with their views on all things (those who do insist on this quickly
                find themselves unable to work in any project). But you do need to be
                aware that the question of "free" versus "open source" exists, partly
                to avoid saying things that might be inimical to some of the
                participants, and partly because understanding developers' motivations
                is the best wayâin some sense, the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
                wayâto manage a project.</p>

            <p>Free software is a culture by choice. To operate successfully
                in it, you have to understand why people choose to be in it in the
                first place. Coercive techniques don't work. If people are unhappy in
                one project, they will just wander off to another one. Free software
                is remarkable even among volunteer communities for its lightness of
                investment. Most of the people involved have never actually met the
                other participants face-to-face, and simply donate bits of time
                whenever they feel like it. The normal conduits by which humans bond
                with each other and form lasting groups are narrowed down to a tiny
                channel: the written word, carried over electronic wires. Because of
                this, it can take a long time for a cohesive and dedicated group to
                form. Conversely, it's quite easy for a project to lose a potential
                volunteer in the first five minutes of acquaintanceship. If a project
                doesn't make a good first impression, newcomers may wait a long time
                before giving it a second chance.</p>

            <p>The transience, or rather the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span>
                transience, of relationships is perhaps the single most daunting task
                facing a new project. What will persuade all these people to stick
                together long enough to produce something useful? The answer to that
                question is complex enough to occupy the rest of this book, but if it
                had to be expressed in one sentence, it would be this:</p>

                    a

                Clearly, projects with corporate
                sponsorship and/or salaried developers need to be especially careful
                in this regard, as <a class="xref" href="#money" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Money">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Money</i></a>
                discusses in detail. Of
                course, this doesn't mean that if there's no corporate sponsorship
                then you have nothing to worry about. Money is merely one of many
                factors that can affect the success of a project. There are also
                questions of what language to choose, what license, what development
                process, precisely what kind of infrastructure to set up, how to
                publicize the project's inception effectively, and much more.

                Linux was not the first. A free
                operating system for IBM-compatible computers, called 386BSD, had come
                out shortly before Linux. However, it was a lot harder to get 386BSD
                up and running. Linux made such a splash not only because it was
                free, but because it actually had a high chance of successfully
                booting your computer after you installed it.</p></div>

            <p>The classic model of how free software projects get started was
                supplied by Eric Raymond, in a now-famous paper on open source
                processes entitled <em class="citetitle">The Cathedral and the
                    Bazaar</em>. He wrote:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Every good work of software starts by
                    scratching
                    a developer's personal itch.</em></span></p>

                    <p>(from <span class="bold"><strong><a class="ulink"
                                                           href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/"
                                                           target="_top">catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/</a>
                    </strong></span>)</p></blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>Note that Raymond wasn't saying that open source projects happen
                only when some individual gets an itch. Rather, he was saying that
                <span class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span> software results when the programmer has a
                personal interest in seeing the problem solved; the relevance of this
                to free software was that a personal itch happened to be the most
                frequent motivation for starting a free software project.</p>

            <p>This is still how most free software projects are started, but less so
                now than in 1997, when Raymond wrote those words. Today, we have the
                phenomenon of organizationsâfor-profit corporations,
                governments, non-profits, etcâstarting large, centrally-conceived
                open source
                projects from scratch. The lone programmer, banging out some code to
                solve a local problem and then realizing the result has wider
                applicability, is still the source of much new free software, but is
                not the only story.</p>

            <p>Raymond's point is still insightful, however. The essential
                condition is that the producers of the software have a direct interest
                in its success, usually because they use it themselves or work
                directly with people who use it. If the software
                doesn't do what it's supposed to do, the person or organization
                producing it will feel the dissatisfaction in their daily work. For
                example, the open source software developed by the Kuali Foundation
                (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kuali.org/" target="_top">kuali.org</a>), used by educational
                institutions to manage their finances, research grants, HR systems,
                student information, etc, can hardly be said to scratch any individual
                programmer's personal itch. It
                scratches an institutional itch. But that itch arises directly from
                the experiences of the institutions concerned, and therefore if
                the project fails to satisfy them, they will know. This arrangement
                produces good software because the feedback loop flows in the right
                direction. The program isn't being written to be sold to someone else
                so they can solve <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> problem. It's being
                written to solve one's <span class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> problem, and then
                shared with everyone, much as though the problem were a disease and
                the software were medicine whose distribution is meant to completely
                eradicate the epidemic.</p>

            <p>This chapter is about how to introduce a new free software
                project to the world, but many of its recommendations would sound
                familiar to a health organization distributing medicine. The goals
                are very similar: you want to make it clear what the medicine does,
                get it into the hands of the right people, and make sure that those
                who receive it know how to use it. But with software, you also want
                to entice some of the recipients into joining the ongoing research
                effort to improve the medicine.</p>

            <p>Free software distribution is a twofold task. The software
                needs to acquire users, and to acquire developers. These two needs
                are not necessarily in conflict, but they do add some complexity to a
                project's initial presentation. Some information is useful for both
                audiences, some is useful only for one or the other. Both kinds of
                information should subscribe to the principle of scaled presentation;
                that is, the degree of detail presented at each stage should
                correspond to the amount of time and effort put in by the
                reader at that stage. More effort should always result in more
                reward. When the two do
                not correlate tightly, people may quickly lose faith and stop
                investing effort.</p>

            <p>The corollary to this is that <span class="emphasis"><em>appearances
                matter</em></span>. Programmers, in particular, often don't like to
                believe this. Their love of substance over form is almost a point of
                professional pride. It's no accident that so many programmers exhibit
                an antipathy for marketing and public relations work, nor that
                professional graphic designers are often horrified at the designs
                programmers come up with on their own.</p>

            <p>This is a pity, because there are situations where form
                <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> substance, and project presentation is one of
                them. For example, the very first thing a visitor learns about a
                project is what its web site looks like. This information is absorbed
                before any of the actual content on the site is
                comprehendedâbefore any of the text has been read or links
                clicked on. However unjust it may be, people cannot stop themselves
                from forming an immediate first impression. The site's appearance
                signals whether care was taken in organizing the project's
                presentation. Humans have extremely sensitive antennae for detecting
                the investment of care. Most of us can tell in one glance whether a
                web site was thrown together quickly or was given serious thought.
                This is the first piece of information your project puts out, and the
                impression it creates will carry over to the rest of the project by
                association.</p>

            <p>Thus, while much of this chapter talks about the content your
                project should start out with, remember that its look and feel matter
                too. Because the project web site has to work for two different types
                of visitorsâusers and developersâspecial attention
                must be paid to clarity and directedness. Although this is not the
                place for a general treatise on web design, one principle is important
                enough to deserve mention, particularly when the site serves multiple
                (if overlapping) audiences: people should have a rough idea where a
                link goes before clicking on it. For example, it should be obvious
                <span class="emphasis"><em>from looking at the links</em></span> to user documentation
                that they lead to user documentation, and not to, say, developer
                documentation. Running a project is partly about supplying
                information, but it's also about supplying comfort. The mere presence
                of certain standard offerings, in expected places, reassures users and
                developers who are deciding whether they want to get involved. It
                says that this project has its act together, has anticipated the
                questions people will ask, and has made an effort to answer them in a
                way that requires minimal exertion on the part of the asker. By
                giving off this aura of preparedness, the project sends out a message:
                "Your time will not be wasted if you get involved," which is exactly
                what people need to hear.</p>

            <p>If you use a "canned hosting" site (see <a class="xref" href="#starting-with-canned-hosting">the section
                called âHostingâ</a>), one advantage of that
                choice is that those sites have a default layout that is similar from
                project to project, and is pretty well-suited to presenting a project
                to the world. That layout can be customized, within certain
                boundaries, but the default design prompts you to include the

                <p>Before starting an open source project, there is one important
                    caveat:</p>

                <p>Always look around to see if there's an existing project that
                    does what you want. The chances are pretty good that whatever problem
                    you want solved now, someone else wanted solved before you. If they
                    did solve it, and released their code under a free license, then
                    there's no reason for you to reinvent the wheel today. There are
                    exceptions, of course: if you want to start a project as an
                    educational experience, pre-existing code won't help; or maybe the
                    project you have in mind is so specialized that you know there is zero
                    chance anyone else has done it. But generally, there's no point not
                    looking, and the payoff can be huge. If the usual Internet search
                    engines don't turn up anything, try searching directly on <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/"
                                                                                 target="_top">github.com</a>, <a

                <p>Even if you don't find exactly what you were looking for, you
                    might find something so close that it makes more sense to join that
                    project and add functionality than to start from scratch
                    yourself.</p></div>

            </div>
            <p>You've looked around, found that nothing out there really fits
                your needs, and decided to start a new project.</p>

            <p>What now?</p>

            <p>The hardest part about launching a free software project is
                transforming a private vision into a public one. You or your
                organization may know perfectly well what you want, but expressing
                that goal comprehensibly to the world is a fair amount of work. It is
                essential, however, that you take the time to do it. You and the
                other founders must decide what the project is really aboutâthat
                is, decide its limitations, what it <span class="emphasis"><em>won't</em></span> do as
                well as what it willâand write up a mission statement. This
                part is usually not too hard, though it can sometimes reveal unspoken
                assumptions and even disagreements about the nature of the project,
                which is fine: better to resolve those now than later. The next step
                is to package up the project for public consumption, and this is,
                basically, pure drudgery.</p>

            <p>What makes it so laborious is that it consists mainly of
                organizing and documenting things everyone already
                knowsâ"everyone", that is, who's been involved in the project so
                far. Thus, for the people doing the work, there is no immediate
                benefit. They do not need a <code class="filename">README</code> file giving
                an overview of the project, nor a design document.
                They do not need a carefully arranged code tree conforming to the
                informal but widespread standards of software source distributions.
                Whatever way the source code is arranged is fine for them, because
                they're already accustomed to it anyway, and if the code runs at all,
                they know how to use it. It doesn't even matter, for them, if the
                fundamental architectural assumptions of the project remain
                undocumented; they're already familiar with that too.</p>

            <p>Newcomers, on the other hand, need all these things. Fortunately,
                they don't need them all at once. It's not necessary for you to
                provide every possible resource before taking a project public. In a
                perfect world, perhaps, every new open source project would start out
                life with a thorough design document, a complete user manual (with
                special markings for features planned but not yet implemented),
                beautifully and portably packaged code, capable of running on any
                computing platform, and so on. In reality, taking care of all these
                loose ends would be prohibitively time-consuming, and anyway, it's
                work that one can reasonably hope others will help with once the
                project is under way.</p>

            <p>What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> necessary, however, is that enough
                investment be put into presentation that newcomers can get past the
                initial obstacle of unfamiliarity. Think of it as the first step in a
                bootstrapping process, to bring the project to a kind of minimum
                activation energy. I've heard this threshold called the
                <em class="firstterm">hacktivation energy</em>: the amount of energy a
                newcomer must put in before she starts getting something back. The
                lower a project's hacktivation energy, the better. Your first task is
                bring the hacktivation energy down to a level that encourages people
                to get involved.</p>

            <p>Each of the following subsections describes one important aspect
                of starting a new project. They are presented roughly in the order
                that a new visitor would encounter them, though of course the order in
                which you actually implement them might be different. You can treat
                them as a checklist. When starting a project, just go down the list
                and make sure you've got each item covered, or at least that you're
                comfortable with the potential consequences if you've left one
                out.</p>

                <p>Put yourself in the shoes of someone who's just heard about your
                    project, perhaps by having stumbled across it while searching for
                    software to solve some problem. The first thing they'll encounter is
                    the project's name.</p>

                <p>A good name will not automatically make your project successful,
                    and a bad name will not doom itâwell, a
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> bad name probably could do that, but we
                    start from the assumption that no one here is actively trying to make
                    their project fail. However, a bad name can slow down adoption of the
                    project, either because people don't take it seriously, or because
                    they simply have trouble remembering it.</p>

                <p>A good name:

                            "easy for someone who can read English to remember." Names that
                            are puns dependent on native-speaker pronounciation, for

                            and memorable, it may still be worth it; just keep in mind
                            that many people seeing the name will not hear it in their
                            head the way a native speaker would.</p></li>

                    <p>For large projects, it is a good idea to own the project's name
                        as many of the relevant namespaces on the Internet as you can. By
                        namespaces, I mean not just the domain name system, but also online
                        services in which account names (usernames) are the publicly visible
                        handle by which people refer to the project. If you have the same
                        name in all the places where people would look for you, you make it
                        easier for people to sustain a mild interest in the project until
                        they're ready to become more involved.</p>

                    <p>For example, the Gnome free desktop project has the <a class="ulink" href="http://gnome.org/"
                                                                              target="_top">gnome.org</a> domain
                        name<sup>[<a name="idp5448800" href="#ftn.idp5448800" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup>, the <a

                        the <a class="ulink" href="https://identi.ca/gnome" target="_top">gnome</a> username at

                        GitHub.com<sup>[<a name="idp5454080" href="#ftn.idp5454080" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup>, and
                        on the freenode IRC
                        network (see <a class="xref" href="#irc" title="IRC / Real-Time Chat Systems">the section called
                            âIRC / Real-Time Chat Systemsâ</a>) they have the channel
                        <code class="code">#gnome</code>, although they also maintain their own IRC servers
                        (where they control the channel namespace anyway, of course).</p>

                    <p>All this makes the Gnome project splendidly easy to find: it's
                        usually right where a potential contributor would expect it to be. Of
                        course, Gnome is a large and complex project with thousands of
                        contributors and many subdivisions; the advantage to Gnome of being
                        easy to find is greater than it would be for a newer project, since by
                        now there are so many ways to get involved in Gnome. But it will
                        certainly never <span class="emphasis"><em>harm</em></span> your project to own its name
                        in as many of the relevant namespaces as it can, and it can sometimes
                        help. So when you start a project, think about what its online handle
                        should be and register that handle with the online services you think
                        you're likely to care about. The ones mentioned above are probably a
                        good initial list, but you may know others that are relevant for the

                <p>Once they've found the project's home site, the next thing people
                    will look for is a quick description or mission statement, so they can
                    decide (within 30 seconds) whether or not they're interested in
                    learning more. This should be prominently placed on the front page,
                    preferably right under the project's name.</p>

                <p>The description should be concrete, limiting, and above all,
                    short. Here's an example of a good one, from <a class="ulink" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/"
                                                                    target="_top">hadoop.apache.org</a>:</p>

                            designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines,
                            each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on
                            hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is
                            designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so
                            delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of

                </div>
                <p>In just four sentences, they've hit all the high points, largely
                    by drawing on the reader's prior knowledge. That's an important
                    point: it's okay to assume a minimally informed reader with a baseline
                    level of preparedness. A reader who doesn't know what "clusters" and
                    "high-availability" mean in this context probably can't make much use
                    of Hadoop anyway, so there's no point writing for a reader who knows
                    any less than that. The phrase "designed to detect and handle
                    failures at the application layer" will stand out to engineers who
                    have experience with large-scale computing clustersâwhen they
                    see those words, they'll know that the people behind Hadoop understand
                    that world, and will thus be more willing to give Hadoop
                    consideration.</p>

                <p>Those who remain interested after reading the mission statement
                    will next want to see more details, perhaps some user or developer
                    documentation, and eventually will want to download something. But
                    before any of that, they'll need to be sure it's open source.</p></div>

                    would be surprised how many projects forget to do it. I have seen
                    free software project web sites where the front page not only did not
                    say which particular free license the software was distributed under,
                    but did not even state outright that the software was free at all.
                    Sometimes the crucial bit of information was relegated to the
                    Downloads page, or the Developers page, or some other place that
                    required one more mouse click to get to. In extreme cases, the
                    license was not given anywhere on the web site at allâthe only
                    way to find it was to download the software and look at a license file
                    inside.</p>

                <p>Please don't make this mistake. Such an omission can lose many
                    potential developers and users. State up front, right below the
                    mission statement, that the project is "free software" or "open source
                    software", and give the exact license. A quick guide to choosing a
                    license is given in

                <p>There should be a brief list of the features the software
                    supports (if something isn't completed yet, you can still list it, but
                    put "<span class="emphasis"><em>planned</em></span>" or
                    "<span class="emphasis"><em>in&nbsp;progress</em></span>" next to it), and the kind of
                    computing environment required to run the software. Think of the
                    features/requirements list as what you would give to someone asking
                    for a quick summary of the software. It is often just a logical
                    expansion of the mission statement. For example, the mission
                    statement might say:</p>

                <p>Visitors usually want to know how a project is doing. For new
                    projects, they want to know the gap between the project's promise and
                    current reality. For mature projects, they want to know how actively
                    it is maintained, how often it puts out new releases, how responsive
                    it is likely to be to bug reports, etc.</p>

                <p>There are a couple of different avenues for providing answers to
                    these questions. One is to have a development status page, listing
                    the project's near-term goals and needs (for example, it might be
                    looking for developers with a particular kind of expertise). The page
                    can also give a history of past releases, with feature lists, so
                    visitors can get an idea of how the project defines "progress", and
                    how quickly it makes progress according to that definition. Some
                    projects structure their development status page as a roadmap that
                    includes the future: past events are shown on the dates they actually
                    happened, future ones on the approximate dates the project hopes they
                    will happen.</p>

                <p>The other way&nbsp;â&nbsp;not mutually exclusive with the
                    first, and in fact probably best done in combination with
                    it&nbsp;â&nbsp;is to have various automatically-maintained
                    counters and indicators embedded in the projects's front page and/or
                    its developer landing page, showing various pieces of information
                    that, in the aggregate, give a sense of the project's development
                    status and progress. For example, an Announcements or News panel
                    showing recent news items, a Twitter or other microblog stream showing
                    notices that match the project's designated hashtags, a timeline of
                    recent releases, a panel showing recent activity in the bug tracker
                    (bugs filed, bugs responded to), another showing mailing list or
                    discussion forum activity, etc. Each such indicator should be a
                    gateway to further information of its type: for example, clicking on
                    the "recent bugs" panel should take one to the full bug tracker, or at
                    least to an expanded view into bug tracker activity.</p>

                <p>Really, there are two slightly different meanings of
                    "development status" being conflated here. One is the formal sense:
                    where does the project stand in relation to its stated goals, and how
                    fast is it making progress. The other is less formal but just as
                    useful: how active is this project? Is stuff going on? Are there
                    people here, getting things done? Often that latter notion is what a
                    visitor is most interested in. Whether or not a project met its most
                    recent milestone is sometimes not as interesting as the more
                    fundamental question of whether it has an active community of
                    developers around it.</p>

                <p>The two notions of development status are, of course, related,
                    and a well-presented project shows both kinds. The information can be
                    divided between the project's front page (show enough there to give an
                    overview of both types of development status) and a more
                    developer-oriented page.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>One site that does a pretty good job of showing
                        developer-oriented status indicators is Launchpad.net. Launchpad.net
                        is a bit unusual in that it is both a primary hosting platform for
                        some projects, and a secondary, packaging-oriented site for others (or
                        rather, for those others it is the primary site for the "project" of
                        getting that particular program packaged for the Ubuntu GNU/Linux
                        operating system, which Launchpad was specifically designed to
                        support). In either case, a project's landing page on Launchpad shows
                        a variety of automatically-maintained status indicators that quickly
                        give an idea of where the project stands. While simply imitating a
                        Launchpad page is probably not a good idea&nbsp;â&nbsp;your own
                        project should think carefully about what its best development status
                        indicators are&nbsp;â&nbsp;Launchpad project pages do provide
                        some good examples of the possibilities. Start from the top of a

                        kinds of developers you need at that stage. As for users, one of the
                        worst things a project can do is attract users before the software is
                        ready for them. A reputation for instability or bugginess is very
                        hard to shake, once acquired. Conservativism pays off in the long
                        run; it's always better for the software to be
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> stable than the user expected than less, and
                        pleasant surprises produce the best kind of word-of-mouth.</p>

                        <p>The term <em class="firstterm">alpha</em> usually means a first
                            release, with which users can get real work done and which has all
                            the intended functionality, but which also has known bugs. The main
                            purpose of alpha software is to generate feedback, so the developers
                            know what to work on. The next stage, <em class="firstterm">beta</em>,
                            means the software has had all the serious bugs fixed, but has not
                            yet been tested enough to certify for production release. The purpose of beta
                            software is to either become the official release, assuming no bugs
                            are found, or provide detailed feedback to the developers so they
                            can reach the official release quickly. The difference between
                            alpha and beta is very much a matter of judgement.</p></div>

                <p>The software should be downloadable as source code in standard
                    formats. When a project is first getting started, binary (executable)
                    packages are not necessary, unless the software has such complicated
                    build requirements or dependencies that merely getting it to run would
                    be a lot of work for most people. (But if this is the case, the
                    project is going to have a hard time attracting developers
                    anyway!)</p>

                <p>The distribution mechanism should be as convenient, standard,
                    and low-overhead as possible. If you were trying to eradicate a
                    disease, you wouldn't distribute the medicine in such a way that it
                    requires a non-standard syringe size to administer. Likewise,
                    software should conform to standard build and installation methods;
                    the more it deviates from the standards, the more potential users and
                    developers will give up and go away confused.</p>

                <p>That sounds obvious, but many projects don't bother to
                    standardize their installation procedures until very late in the game,
                    telling themselves they can do it any time: <span class="emphasis"><em>"We'll sort all
                        that stuff out when the code is closer to being ready."</em></span>
                    What they don't realize is that by putting off the boring work of
                    finishing the build and installation procedures, they are actually
                    making the code take longer to get readyâbecause they
                    discourage developers who might otherwise have contributed to the
                    code, if only they could build and test it. Most insidiously, the
                    project won't even <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> it's
                    losing all those developers, because the process is an accumulation of
                    non-events: someone visits a web site, downloads the software, tries
                    to build it, fails, gives up and goes away. Who will ever know it
                    happened, except the person themselves? No one working on the project
                    will realize that someone's interest and good will have been silently
                    squandered.</p>

                <p>Boring work with a high payoff should always be done early, and
                    significantly lowering the project's barrier to entry through good
                    packaging brings a very high payoff.</p>

                <p>When you release a downloadable package, give it a unique
                    version number, so that people can compare any two releases and know
                    which supersedes the other. That way they can report bugs against a
                    particular release (which helps respondents to figure out if the bug
                    is already fixed or not). A detailed discussion of version

                    they're still not fine-grained enough for a thriving development
                    community. People need real-time access to the latest sources, and a
                    way to submit changes based on those sources.</p>

                <p>The solution is to use a version control
                    system&nbsp;â&nbsp;specifically, an online, publicly-accessible
                    version controlled repository, from which anyone can check out the
                    project's materials and subsequently get updates. A version control
                    repository is a signâto both users and developersâthat
                    this project is making an effort to give people what they need to
                    participate. As of this writing, many open source projects use <a class="ulink"
                                                                                      href="https://github.com/"

                    which offers unlimited
                    free public version control hosting for open source projects. While
                    GitHub is not the only choice, nor even the only good choice, it's a
                    reasonable one for most projects<sup>[<a name="idp5512240" href="#ftn.idp5512240" class="footnote">15</a>]</sup>.
                    Version control infrastructure is discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="#vc"

                <p>The same goes for the project's bug tracker. The importance of
                    a bug tracking system lies not only in its day-to-day usefulness to
                    developers, but in what it signifies for project observers. For many
                    people, an accessible bug database is one of the strongest signs that
                    a project should be taken seriously: the higher the number of bugs in
                    the database, the <span class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span> the project looks. This
                    might seem counterintuitive, but remember that the number of bug
                    reports filed really depends on three things: the absolute number of
                    actual software defects present in the code, the number of people
                    using the software,
                    and the convenience with which those people can report new bugs. Of
                    these three factors, the latter two are much more significant than the
                    first. Any software of sufficient size and complexity has an
                    essentially arbitrary number of bugs waiting to be discovered. The
                    real question is, how well will the project do at recording and
                    prioritizing those bugs? A project with a large and well-maintained
                    bug database (meaning bugs are responded to promptly, duplicate bugs
                    are unified, etc.) therefore makes a better impression than a project
                    with no bug database, or a nearly empty database.</p>

                <p>Of course, if your project is just getting started, then the bug
                    database will contain very few bugs, and there's not much you can do
                    about that. But if the status page emphasizes the project's youth,
                    and if people looking at the bug database can see that most filings
                    have taken place recently, they can extrapolate from that the project
                    still has a healthy <span class="emphasis"><em>rate</em></span> of filings, and they
                    will not be unduly alarmed by the low absolute number of bugs
                    recorded.<sup>[<a name="idp5518864" href="#ftn.idp5518864" class="footnote">16</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>Note that bug trackers are often used to track not only software
                    bugs, but enhancement requests, documentation changes, pending tasks,
                    and more. The details of running a bug tracker are covered in
                    <a class="xref" href="#bug-tracker" title="Bug Tracker">the section called âBug Trackerâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>, so I won't
                    go into them here. The important thing from a presentation point of
                    view is just to <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> a bug tracker, and to make
                    sure that fact is visible from the front page of the project.</p></div>

                <p>Visitors usually want to know how to reach the human beings

                    chat rooms, IRC channels (<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                                 title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                        <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a>),
                    and any other forums where others
                    involved with the software can be reached. Make it clear that you and
                    the other authors of the project are subscribed to these mailing
                    lists, so people see there's a way to give feedback that will reach
                    the developers. Your presence on the lists does not imply a
                    committment to answer all questions or implement all feature requests.
                    In the long run, probably only a fraction users will use the forums
                    anyway, but the others will be comforted to know that they
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> if they ever needed to.</p>

                <p>In the early stages of a project, there's no need to have
                    separate user and developer forums. It's much better to have everyone
                    involved with the software talking together, in one "room." Among
                    early adopters, the distinction between developer and user is often
                    fuzzy; to the extent that the distinction can be made, the ratio of
                    developers to users is usually much higher in the early days of the
                    project than later on. While you can't assume that every early
                    adopter is a programmer who wants to hack on the software, you can
                    assume that they are at least interested in following development
                    discussions and in getting a sense of the project's direction.</p>

                <p>As this chapter is only about getting a project started, it's
                    enough merely to say that these communications forums need to exist.

                    moderation or other management, and how to separate user forums from
                    developer forums, when the time comes, without creating an

                    No pejorative sense is intended by "dictatorship", by the way. It's
                    perfectly okay to run a tyranny where one particular developer has
                    veto power over all changes. Many successful projects work this way.
                    The important thing is that the project come right out and say so. A
                    tyranny pretending to be a democracy will turn people off; a tyranny
                    that says it's a tyranny will do fine as long as the tyrant is
                    competent and trusted. (See <a class="xref" href="#forkability" title="Forkability">the section

                <p>Documentation is essential. There needs to be
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> for people to read, even if it's
                    rudimentary and incomplete. This falls squarely into the "drudgery"
                    category referred to earlier, and is often the first area where a new
                    open source project falls down. Coming up with a mission statement
                    and feature list, choosing a license, summarizing development
                    statusâthese are all relatively small tasks, which can be
                    definitively completed and usually need not be revisited once done.
                    Documentation, on the other hand, is never really finished, which may
                    be one reason people sometimes delay starting it at all.</p>

                <p>The most insidious thing is that documentation's utility to
                    those writing it is the reverse of its utility to those who will read
                    it. The most important documentation for initial users is the basics:
                    how to quickly set up the software, an overview of how it works,
                    perhaps some guides to doing common tasks. Yet these are exactly the
                    things the <span class="emphasis"><em>writers</em></span> of the documentation know all
                    too wellâso well that it can be difficult for them to see
                    things from the reader's point of view, and to laboriously spell out
                    the steps that (to the writers) seem so obvious as to be unworthy of
                    mention.</p>

                <p>There's no magic solution to this problem. Someone just needs
                    to sit down and write the stuff, and then, most importantly,
                    incorporate feedback from readers. Use a simple, easy-to-edit format
                    such as HTML, plain text, Markdown, ReStructuredText, or some
                    variant of XMLâsomething that's convenient for lightweight,
                    quick improvements on the spur of the moment<sup>[<a name="idp5546032" href="#ftn.idp5546032"
                                                                         class="footnote">17</a>]</sup>. This is not
                    only to remove any
                    overhead that might impede the original writers from making
                    incremental improvements, but also for those who join the project
                    later and want to work on the documentation.</p>

                <p>One way to ensure basic initial documentation gets done is to
                    limit its scope in advance. That way, writing it at least won't feel
                    like an open-ended task. A good rule of thumb is that it should meet
                    the following minimal criteria:</p>

                <div class="itemizedlist">
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Tell the reader clearly how much technical
                            expertise they're expected to have.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Describe clearly and thoroughly how to set up
                            the software, and somewhere near the beginning of the
                            documentation, tell the user how to run some sort of
                            diagnostic test or simple command to confirm that
                            they've set things up correctly. Startup
                            documentation is in some ways more important than
                            actual usage documentation. The more effort someone has
                            invested in installing and getting started with the
                            software, the more persistent she'll be in figuring out
                            advanced functionality that's not well-documented.
                            When people abandon, they abandon early; therefore,
                            it's the earliest stages, like installation, that need
                            the most support.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Give one tutorial-style example of how to do a
                            common task. Obviously, many examples for many tasks
                            would be even better, but if time is limited, pick one
                            task and walk through it thoroughly. Once someone
                            sees that the software <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be
                            used for one thing, they'll start to explore what else
                            it can do on their ownâand, if you're lucky,
                            start filling in the documentation themselves. Which
                            brings us to the next point...</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Label the areas where the documentation is known
                            to be incomplete. By showing the readers that you are
                            aware of its deficiencies, you align yourself with
                            their point of view. Your empathy reassures them that
                            they don't face a struggle to convince the project of
                            what's important. These labels needn't represent
                            promises to fill in the gaps by any particular date
                            âit's equally legitimate to treat them as open
                            requests for volunteer help.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>The last point is of wider importance, actually, and can be
                    applied to the entire project, not just the documentation. An
                    accurate accounting of known deficiencies is the norm in the open
                    source world. You don't have to exaggerate the project's
                    shortcomings, just identify them scrupulously and dispassionately when
                    the context calls for it (whether in the documentation, in the bug
                    tracking database, or on a mailing list discussion). No one will
                    treat this as defeatism on the part of the project, nor as a
                    commitment to solve the problems by a certain date, unless the project
                    makes such a commitment explicitly. Since anyone who uses the
                    software will discover the deficiencies for themselves, it's much
                    better for them to be psychologically preparedâthen the
                    project will look like it has a solid knowledge of how it's
                    doing.</p>

                    <p>A <em class="firstterm">FAQ</em> ("Frequently Asked Questions"
                        document) can be one of the best investments a project makes in
                        terms of educational payoff. FAQs are highly tuned to the questions
                        users and developers actually askâas opposed to the questions
                        you might have <span class="emphasis"><em>expected</em></span> them to askâand
                        therefore, a well-maintained FAQ tends to give those who consult it
                        exactly what they're looking for. The FAQ is often the first place
                        users look when they encounter a problem, often even in preference
                        to the official manual, and it's probably the document in your
                        project most likely to be linked to from other sites.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, you cannot make the FAQ at the start of the
                        project. Good FAQs are not written, they are grown. They are by
                        definition reactive documents, evolving over time in response to
                        the questions people ask about the software. Since it's impossible
                        to correctly anticipate those questions, it is impossible to sit
                        down and write a useful FAQ from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, don't waste your time trying to. You may, however,
                        find it useful to set up a mostly blank FAQ template with just a few
                        questions and answers, so there will
                        be an obvious place for people to contribute questions and answers
                        after the project is under way. At this stage, the most important
                        property is not completeness, but <span class="emphasis"><em>convenience</em></span>:
                        if the FAQ is easy to
                        add to, people will add to it. (Proper FAQ maintenance is a
                        non-trivial and intriguing problem: see <a class="xref" href="#faq-manager">the section called

                    <p>Documentation should be available from two places: online
                        (directly from the web site), <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> in the
                        downloadable distribution of the software (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#packaging" title="Packaging">the section called âPackagingâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Chapter&nbsp;7,
    <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>). It needs to be
                        online, in browsable form, because people often read documentation
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> downloading software for the first time,
                        as a way of helping them decide whether to download at all. But it
                        should also accompany the software, on the principle that downloading
                        should supply (i.e., make locally accessible) everything one needs to
                        use the package.</p>

                    <p>For online documentation, make sure that there is a link that
                        brings up the <span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> documentation in one HTML
                        page (put a note like "monolithic" or "all-in-one" or "single large
                        page" next to the link, so people know that it might take a while to
                        load). This is useful because people often want to search for a
                        specific word or phrase across the entire documentation. Generally,
                        they already know what they're looking for; they just can't remember
                        what section it's in. For such people, nothing is more frustrating
                        than encountering one HTML page for the table of contents, then a
                        different page for the introduction, then a different page for
                        installation instructions, etc. When the pages are broken up like
                        that, their browser's search function is useless. The separate-page
                        style is useful for those who already know what section they need, or
                        who want to read the entire documentation from front to back in
                        sequence. But this is not necessarily the most common way
                        documentation is accessed. Often, someone who is basically
                        familiar with the software is coming back to search for a specific
                        word or phrase, and to fail to provide them with a single, searchable
                        document would only make their lives harder.</p></div>

                    <p>Developer documentation is written by programmers to help other
                        programmers
                        understand the code, so they can repair and extend it. This is
                        somewhat different from the <span class="emphasis"><em>developer guidelines</em></span>
                        discussed earlier, which are more social than technical. Developer
                        guidelines tell programmers how to get along with each other;
                        developer documentation tells them how to get along with the code
                        itself. The two are often packaged together in one document for
                        convenience (as with the <a class="ulink"
                                                    href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/"

                        given
                        earlier), but they don't have to be.</p>

                    <p>Although developer documentation can be very helpful, there's no
                        reason to delay a release to do it. As long as the original authors
                        are available (and willing) to answer questions about the code, that's
                        enough to start with. In fact, having to answer the same questions
                        over and over is a common motivation for writing documentation. But
                        even before it's written, determined contributors will still manage to
                        find their way around the code. The force that drives people to spend
                        time learning a code base is that the code does something useful for
                        them. If people have faith in that, they will take the time to figure
                        things out; if they don't have that faith, no amount of developer
                        documentation will get or keep them.</p>

                    <p>So if you have time to write documentation for only one
                        audience, write it for users. All user documentation is, in effect,
                        developer documentation as well; any programmer who's going to work on
                        a piece of software will need to be familiar with how to use it too.
                        Later, when you see programmers asking the same questions over and
                        over, take the time to write up some separate documents just for
                        them.</p>

                    <p>Some projects use wikis for their initial documentation, or even
                        as their primary documentation. In my experience, this works best
                        if the wiki is actively maintained by a few people who agree on how
                        the documentation is to be organized and what sort of "voice" it
                        should have. See

                <p>If the project involves a graphical user interface, or if it
                    produces graphical or otherwise distinctive output, put some samples
                    up on the project web site. In the case of interface, this means
                    screenshots or, better yet, a brief (4 minutes or fewer) video with
                    subtitles or a narrator. For output, it might be screenshots or just
                    sample files to download. For web-based software, the gold standard
                    is a demo site, of course, assuming the software is amenable to
                    that.</p>

                <p>The main thing is to cater to people's desire for instant
                    gratification in the way they are most likely to expect. A single
                    screenshot or video can be more convincing than paragraphs of
                    descriptive text and mailing list chatter, because it is proof
                    that the software <span class="emphasis"><em>works</em></span>. The code may still be
                    buggy, it may be hard to install, it may be incompletely documented,
                    but image-based evidence shows people that if one puts in enough effort,
                    one can get it to run.</p>

                    <p>If you have a video demonstration of your project, keep the
                        video under 4 minutes long, and make sure people can see the
                        duration <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> they click on it. This is in
                        keeping with the "principle of scaled presentation" mentioned
                        earlier: you want to make the decision to watch the video an easy
                        one, by removing all the risk. Visitors are more likely to click on
                        a link that says "Watch our 3 minute video" than on one that just
                        says "Watch our video", because in the former case they know what
                        they're getting into before they click&nbsp;â&nbsp;and they'll
                        watch it better, because they've mentally prepared the necessary
                        amount of commitment beforehand, and so won't tire mid-way
                        through.</p>

                    <p>As to where the four-minute limit came from: it's a scientific
                        fact, determined through many attempts by the same experimental
                        subject (who shall remain unnamed) to watch project videos. The
                        limit does not apply to tutorials or other instructional material,
                        of course; it's just for introductory videos.</p>

                    <p>In case you don't already have preferred software for
                        recording desktop interaction videos: I've had good luck with
                        <code class="filename">gtk-recordmydesktop</code> on Debian GNU/Linux, and
                        then the <code class="filename">OpenShot</code> video editor for post-capture
                        editing.</p></div>
            </div>
            <p>There are many other things you could put on the project web
                site, if you have the time, or if for one reason or another they are
                especially appropriate: a news page, a project history page, a related
                links page, a site-search feature, a donations link, etc. None of
                these are necessities at startup time, but keep them in mind for the
                future.</p>

                <p>Where on the Internet should you put the project's materials?</p>

                <p>A web site, obviously&nbsp;â&nbsp;but the full answer
                    is a little more complicated than that.</p>

                <p>Many projects distinguish between their primary public user-facing
                    web site&nbsp;â&nbsp;the one with the pretty pictures and the
                    "About" page and the gentle introductions and videos and guided tours
                    and all that stuff&nbsp;â&nbsp;and their developers' site, where
                    everything's grungy and full of closely-spaced text in monospace fonts
                    and impenetrable abbreviations.</p>

                <p>Well, I exaggerate. A bit. In any case, in the early stages of
                    your project it is not so important to distinguish between these two
                    audiences. Most of the interested visitors you get will be
                    developers, or at least people who are comfortable trying out new
                    code. Over time, you may find it makes sense to have a user-facing
                    site (of course, if your project is a code library, those "users"
                    might be other programmers) and a somewhat separate collaboration area
                    for those interested in participating in development. The
                    collaboration site would have the code repository, bug tracker,
                    development wiki, links to development mailing lists, etc. The two
                    sites should link to each other, and in particular it's important that
                    the user-facing site make it clear that the project is open source and
                    where the open source development activity can be
                    found.<sup>[<a name="idp5604224" href="#ftn.idp5604224" class="footnote">18</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>In the past, many projects set up the developer site and
                    infrastructure themselves. Over the last decade or so, however, most
                    open source projects&nbsp;â&nbsp;and almost all the new
                    ones&nbsp;â&nbsp;just use one of the "canned hosting" sites that
                    have sprung up to offer these services for free to open source
                    projects. By far the most popular such site, as of this writing in
                    mid-2013, is <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/" target="_top">GitHub.com</a>, and
                    if you don't have a strong preference about where to host, you should
                    probably just choose GitHub; many developers are already familiar with
                    it and have personal accounts there. <a class="xref" href="#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the

                <p>The terms "free software license" and "open source license"
                    are essentially synonymous, and I treat them so throughout this
                    book.</p>

                <p>Technically, the former term refers to licenses confirmed by
                    the Free Software Foundation as offering the "four freedoms"
                    necessary for free software (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"

                    latter term refers
                    to licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative as meeting the
                    Open Source Definition (<a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.org/osd" target="_top">opensource.org/osd</a>).
                    However, if you read the FSF's
                    definition of free software, and the OSI's definition of open source
                    software, it becomes obvious that the two definitions delineate the
                    same freedoms&nbsp;â&nbsp;not surprisingly, as <a class="xref" href="#free-vs-open-source"
                                                                      title="&quot;Free&quot; Versus &quot;Open Source&quot;">the

                    some sense deliberate, result is that the two organizations have

            <p>There are a great many free software licenses to choose from.
                Most of them we needn't consider here, as they were written to satisfy
                the particular legal needs of some corporation or person, and wouldn't
                be appropriate for your project. We will restrict ourselves to just
                the most commonly used licenses; in most cases, you will want to

                <p>Once you've chosen a license, you'll need to apply it to the
                    software.</p>

                <p>The first thing to do is state the license clearly on the
                    project's front page. You don't need to include the actual text of
                    the license there; just give its name and make it link to the full
                    license text on another page. That tells the public what license you
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>intend</em></span> the software to be released
                    underâbut it's not quite sufficient for legal purposes. The
                    other step is that the software itself should include the
                    license.</p>

                <p>The standard way to do this is to put the full license text in a
                    file called <code class="filename">COPYING</code> (or
                    <code class="filename">LICENSE</code>) included with the source code, and then
                    put a short notice in a comment at the top of each source file, naming
                    the copyright date, holder, and license, and saying where to find the
                    full text of the license.</p>

                <p>There are many variations on this pattern, so we'll look at just
                    one example here. The GNU GPL says to put a notice like this at the
                    top of each source file:</p><pre class="screen">Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

</pre>
                <p>It does not say specifically that the copy of the license you
                    received along with the program is in the file
                    <code class="filename">COPYING</code> or <code class="filename">LICENSE</code>, but
                    that's where it's usually put. (You could change the above notice to
                    state that directly, but there's no real need to.)</p>

                <p>In general, the notice you put in each source file does not have
                    to look exactly like the one above, as long as it starts with the same
                    notice of copyright holder and date<sup>[<a name="idp5638832" href="#ftn.idp5638832"

                    license, and
                    makes clear where to view the full license terms. It's always best to
                    consult a lawyer, of course, if you can afford one.</p></div>

            <p>So far we've covered one-time tasks you do during project setup:
                picking a license, arranging the initial web site, etc. But the most
                important aspects of starting a new project are dynamic. Choosing a
                mailing list address is easy; ensuring that the list's conversations
                remain on-topic and productive is another matter entirely. For
                example, if the project is being opened up after years of closed,
                in-house development, its development processes will change, and you
                will have to prepare the existing developers for that change.</p>

            <p>The first steps are the hardest, because precedents and
                expectations for future conduct have not yet been set. Stability in a
                project does not come from formal policies, but from a shared,
                hard-to-pin-down collective wisdom that develops over time. There are
                often written rules as well, but they tend to be essentially a
                distillation of the intangible, ever-evolving agreements that really
                guide the project. The written policies do not define the project's
                culture so much as describe it, and even then only
                approximately.</p>

            <p>There are a few reasons why things work out this way. Growth
                and high turnover are not as damaging to the accumulation of social
                norms as one might think. As long as change does not happen
                <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> quickly, there is time for new arrivals to
                learn how things are done, and after they learn, they will help
                reinforce those ways themselves. Consider how children's songs
                survive for centuries. There are children today singing roughly the
                same rhymes as children did hundreds of years ago, even though there
                are no children alive now who were alive then. Younger children hear
                the songs sung by older ones, and when they are older, they in turn
                will sing them in front of other younger ones. The children are not
                engaging in a conscious program of transmission, of course, but the
                reason the songs survive is nonetheless that they are transmitted
                regularly and repeatedly. The time scale of free software projects
                may not be measured in centuries (we don't know yet), but the dynamics
                of transmission are much the same. The turnover rate is faster,
                however, and must be compensated for by a more active and deliberate
                transmission effort.</p>

            <p>This effort is aided by the fact that people generally show up
                expecting and looking for social norms. That's just how humans are
                built. In any group unified by a common endeavor, people who join
                instinctively search for behaviors that will mark them as part of the
                group. The goal of setting precedents early is to make those
                "in-group" behaviors be ones that are useful to the project; once
                established, they will be largely self-perpetuating.</p>

            <p>Following are some examples of specific things you can do to set
                good precedents. They're not meant as an exhaustive list, just as
                illustrations of the idea that setting a collaborative mood early
                helps a project tremendously. Physically, every developer may be
                working alone in a room by themselves, but you can do a lot to make
                them <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> like they're all working together in
                the same room. The more they feel this way, the more time they'll
                want to spend on the project. I chose these particular examples
                because they came up in the Subversion project (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/"
                                                                   target="_top">subversion.apache.org</a>),
                which I participated in and observed from its very beginning. But
                they're not unique to Subversion; situations like these will come up
                in most open source projects, and should be seen as opportunities to
                start things off on the right foot.</p>

                <p>Even after you've taken the project public, you and the other
                    founders will often find yourselves wanting to settle difficult
                    questions by private communications among an inner circle. This is
                    especially true in the early days of the project, when there are so
                    many important decisions to make, and, usually, few volunteers
                    qualified to make them. All the obvious disadvantages of public list
                    discussions will loom palpably in front of you: the delay inherent in
                    email conversations, the need to leave sufficient time for consensus
                    to form, the hassle of dealing with naive volunteers who think they
                    understand all the issues but actually don't (every project has these;
                    sometimes they're next year's star contributors, sometimes they stay
                    naive forever), the person who can't understand why you only want to
                    solve problem X when it's obviously a subset of larger problem Y, and
                    so on. The temptation to make decisions behind closed doors and
                    present them as <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">faits accomplis</em></span>,
                    or at
                    least as the firm recommendations of a united and influential voting
                    block, will be great indeed.</p>

                <p>Don't do it.</p>

                <p>As slow and cumbersome as public discussion can be, it's
                    almost always preferable in the long run. Making important decisions
                    in private is like spraying contributor repellant on your project. No
                    serious contributor would stick around for long in an environment where
                    a secret council makes all the big decisions. Furthermore, public
                    discussion has beneficial side effects that will last beyond whatever
                    ephemeral technical question was at issue:

                            You never know how many eyes are watching the conversation;
                            even if most people don't participate, many may be lurking
                            silently, gleaning information about the software.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>The discussion will train <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> in

                            familiar with the software as you are. This is a skill that
                            requires practice, and you can't get that practice by talking
                            to people who already know what you know.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>The discussion and its conclusions will be available in public
                            archives forever after, enabling future discussions to avoid
                            retracing the same steps. See

                </p>

                <p>Finally, there is the possibility that someone on the list may
                    make a real contribution to the conversation, by coming up with an
                    idea you never anticipated. It's hard to say how likely this is; it
                    just depends on the complexity of the code and degree of
                    specialization required. But if anecdotal evidence may be permitted,
                    I would hazard that this is more likely than you might intuitively
                    expect. In the Subversion project, we (the founders) believed we
                    faced a deep and complex set of problems, which we had been thinking
                    about hard for several months, and we frankly doubted that anyone on
                    the newly created mailing list was likely to make a real contribution
                    to the discussion. So we took the lazy route and started batting some
                    technical ideas back and forth in private emails, until an observer of
                    the project<sup>[<a name="idp5659872" href="#ftn.idp5659872" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup> caught
                    wind of what
                    was happening and asked for the discussion to be moved to the public
                    list. Rolling our eyes a bit, we didâand were stunned by the
                    number of insightful comments and suggestions that quickly resulted.
                    In many cases people offered ideas that had never even occurred to us.
                    It turned out there were some <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> smart people
                    on that list; they'd just been waiting for the right bait. It's true
                    that the ensuing discussions took longer than they would have if we
                    had kept the conversation private, but they were so much more
                    productive that it was well worth the extra time.</p>

                <p>Without descending into hand-waving generalizations like "the
                    group is always smarter than the individual" (we've all met enough
                    groups to know better), it must be acknowledged that there are certain
                    activities at which groups excel. Massive peer review is one of them;
                    generating large numbers of ideas quickly is another. The quality of
                    the ideas depends on the quality of the thinking that went into them,
                    of course, but you won't know what kinds of thinkers are out there
                    until you stimulate them with a challenging problem.</p>

                <p>Naturally, there are some discussions that must be had
                    privately; throughout this book we'll see examples of those. But the
                    guiding principle should always be: <span class="emphasis"><em>If there's no reason for
                        it to be private, it should be public.</em></span></p>

                <p>Making this happen requires action. It's not enough merely to
                    ensure that all your own posts go to the public list. You also have
                    to nudge other people's unnecessarily private conversations to the
                    list too. If someone tries to start a private discussion with you and
                    there's no reason for it to be private, then it is incumbent on you to open
                    the appropriate meta-discussion immediately. Don't even comment on
                    the original topic until you've either successfully steered the
                    conversation to a public place, or ascertained that privacy really was
                    needed. If you do this consistently, people will catch on pretty
                    quickly and start to use the public forums by default.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Nip Rudeness in the Bud">

                </div>
                <p>From the very start of your project's public existence, you
                    should maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward rude or insulting
                    behavior in its forums. Zero-tolerance does not mean technical
                    enforcement per se. You don't have to remove people from the mailing
                    list when they flame another subscriber, or take away their commit
                    access because they made derogatory comments. (In theory, you might
                    eventually have to resort to such actions, but only after all other
                    avenues have failedâwhich, by definition, isn't the case at the
                    start of the project.) Zero-tolerance simply means never letting bad
                    behavior slide by unnoticed. For example, when someone posts a
                    technical comment mixed together with an <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
                        hominem</em></span> attack on some other developer in the project,
                    it is imperative that your response address the <span class="foreignphrase"><em
                            class="foreignphrase">ad
                        hominem</em></span> attack as a separate issue unto itself,
                    separate from the technical content.</p>

                <p>It is unfortunately very easy, and all too typical, for
                    constructive discussions to lapse into destructive flame wars.
                    People will say things in email that they would never say
                    face-to-face. The topics of discussion only amplify this effect: in
                    technical issues, people often feel there is a single right answer to
                    most questions, and that disagreement with that answer can only be
                    explained by ignorance or stupidity. It's a short distance from
                    calling someone's technical proposal stupid to calling the person
                    themselves stupid. In fact, it's often hard to tell where technical
                    debate leaves off and character attack begins, which is one reason why
                    drastic responses or punishments are not a good idea. Instead, when
                    you think you see it happening, make a post that stresses the
                    importance of keeping the discussion friendly, without accusing anyone
                    of being deliberately poisonous. Such "Nice Police" posts do have an
                    unfortunate tendency to sound like a kindergarten teacher lecturing a
                    class on good behavior:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>First, let's please cut down on the
                        (potentially) ad hominem comments; for example, calling J's
                        design for the security layer "naive and ignorant of the basic
                        principles of computer security." That may be true or it may
                        not, but in either case it's no way to have the discussion. J
                        made his proposal in good faith. If it has deficiencies, point
                        them out, and we'll fix them or get a new design. I'm sure M
                        meant no personal insult to J, but the phrasing was unfortunate,
                        and we try to keep things constructive around here.
                    </em></span></p>

                        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Now, on to the proposal. I think M was right
                            in saying that...</em></span></p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>As stilted as such responses sound, they have a noticeable
                    effect. If you consistently call out bad behavior, but don't demand
                    an apology or acknowledgment from the offending party, then you leave
                    people free to cool down and show their better side by behaving more
                    decorously next timeâand they will.</p>

                <p>One of the secrets of
                    doing this successfully is to never make the meta-discussion the main
                    topic. It should always be an aside, a brief preface to the main
                    portion of your response. Point out in passing that "we don't do
                    things that way around here," but then move on to the real content, so
                    that you're giving people something on-topic to respond to. If
                    someone protests that they didn't deserve your rebuke, simply refuse
                    to be drawn into an argument about it. Either don't respond (if you
                    think they're just letting off steam and don't require a response), or
                    say you're sorry if you overreacted and that it's hard to detect
                    nuance in email, then get back to the main topic. Never, ever insist
                    on an acknowledgment, whether public or private, from someone that
                    they behaved inappropriately. If they choose of their own volition to
                    post an apology, that's great, but demanding that they do so will only
                    cause resentment.</p>

                <p>The overall goal is to make good etiquette be seen as one of the
                    "in-group" behaviors. This helps the project, because developers can
                    be driven away (even from projects they like and want to support) by
                    flame wars. You may not even know that they were driven away; someone
                    might lurk on the mailing list, see that it takes a thick skin to
                    participate in the project, and decide against getting involved at
                    all. Keeping forums friendly is a long-term survival strategy, and
                    it's easier to do when the project is still small. Once it's part of
                    the culture, you won't have to be the only person promoting it. It
                    will be maintained by everyone.</p></div>

                <p>One of the best ways to foster a productive development
                    community is to get people looking at each others'
                    code&nbsp;â&nbsp;ideally, to get them looking at each others'
                    code <span class="emphasis"><em>changes</em></span> as those changes arrive.
                    <em class="firstterm">Commit review</em> (sometimes just called
                    <em class="firstterm">code review</em>) is the practice of reviewing
                    commits as they come in, looking for bugs and possible
                    improvements.</p>

                <p>There are a couple of reasons to focus on reviewing changes,
                    rather than on reviewing code that's been around for a while. First,
                    it just works better socially: when someone reviews your change, she
                    is interacting with work you did recently. That means if she comments
                    on it right away, you will be maximally interested in hearing what she
                    has to say; six months later, you might not feel as motivated to
                    engage, and in any case might not remember the change very well.
                    Second, looking at what changes in a codebase is a gateway to looking
                    at the rest of the code anyway&nbsp;â&nbsp;reviewing a change
                    often causes one to look at the surrounding code, at the affected
                    callers and callees elsewhere, at related module interfaces,
                    etc.<sup>[<a name="idp5678784" href="#ftn.idp5678784" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>Commit review thus serves several purposes simultaneously. It's
                    the most obvious example of peer review in the open source world, and
                    directly helps to maintain software quality. Every bug that ships in
                    a piece of software got there by being committed and not detected;
                    therefore, the more eyes watch commits, the fewer bugs will ship. But
                    commit review also serves an indirect purpose: it confirms to people
                    that what they do matters, because one obviously wouldn't take time to
                    review a commit unless one cared about its effect. People do their
                    best work when they know that others will take the time to evaluate
                    it.</p>

                <p>Reviews should be public. Even on occasions when I have been
                    sitting in the same physical room with another developer, and one of
                    us has made a commit, we take care not to do the review verbally in
                    the room, but to send it to the appropriate online review forum
                    instead. Everyone benefits from seeing the review happen. People
                    follow the commentary and sometimes find flaws in it; even when they
                    don't, it still reminds them that review is an expected, regular
                    activity, like washing the dishes or mowing the lawn.</p>

                <p>Some technical infrastructure is required to do change-by-change
                    review effectively. In particular, setting up commit notifications is
                    extremely useful. The effect of commit notifications is that every
                    time someone commits a change to the central repository, an email or
                    other subscribable notification goes out showing the log message and
                    diffs (unless the diff is too large; see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-diff"><em
                            class="firstterm">diff</em></a>, in <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary"

                        âVersion Control Vocabularyâ</a>).
                    The review itself might take place on a mailing list, or in a review
                    tool such as Gerrit or the GitHub "pull request" interface. See <a class="xref"
                                                                                       href="#commit-notifications"

                    <div class="titlepage">

                    </div>
                    <p>In the Subversion project, we did not at first make a regular
                        practice of code review. There was no guarantee that every commit
                        would be reviewed, though one might sometimes look over a change if
                        one were particularly interested in that area of the code. Bugs
                        slipped in that really could and should have been caught. A developer
                        named Greg Stein, who knew the value of code review from past work,
                        decided that he was going to set an example by reviewing every line of
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>every single commit</em></span> that went into the code
                        repository. Each commit anyone made was soon followed by an email to
                        the developer's list from Greg, dissecting the commit, analyzing
                        possible problems, and occasionally praising a clever bit of code. Right
                        away, he was catching bugs and non-optimal coding practices that would
                        otherwise have slipped by without ever being noticed. Pointedly, he
                        never complained about being the only person reviewing every commit,
                        even though it took a fair amount of his time, but he did sing the
                        praises of code review whenever he had the chance. Pretty soon, other
                        people, myself included, started reviewing commits regularly too.</p>

                    <p>What was our motivation? It wasn't that Greg had consciously shamed
                        us into it. But he had proven that reviewing code was a valuable way
                        to spend time, and that one could contribute as much to the project by
                        reviewing others' changes as by writing new code. Once he
                        demonstrated that, it became expected behavior, to the point where any
                        commit that didn't get some reaction would cause the committer to
                        worry, and even ask on the list whether anyone had had a chance to
                        review it yet. Later, Greg got a job that didn't leave him as much
                        time for Subversion, and had to stop doing regular reviews. But by
                        then, the habit was so ingrained for the rest of us as to seem that it
                        had been going on since time immemorial.</p></div>
                <p>Start doing reviews from very first commit. The sorts of
                    problems that are easiest to catch by reviewing diffs are security
                    vulnerabilities, memory leaks, insufficient comments or API
                    documentation, off-by-one errors, caller/callee discipline mismatches,
                    and other problems that require a minimum of surrounding context to
                    spot. However, even larger-scale issues such as failure to abstract
                    repeated patterns to a single location become spottable after one has
                    been doing reviews regularly, because the memory of past diffs informs
                    the review of present diffs.</p>

                <p>Don't worry that you might not find anything to comment on, or
                    that you don't know enough about every area of the code. There will
                    usually be something to say about almost every commit; even where you
                    don't find anything to question, you may find something to praise.
                    The important thing is to make it clear to every committer that what
                    they do is seen and understood, that attention is being paid. Of
                    course, code review does not absolve programmers of the responsibility
                    to review and test their changes before committing; no one should
                    depend on code review to catch things she ought to have caught on her
                    own.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Be Open From Day One">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>

                <p>Start your project out in the open from the very first day. The
                    longer a project is run in a closed source manner, the harder it is to
                    open source later.<sup>[<a name="idp5692816" href="#ftn.idp5692816" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup>
                </p>

                <p>Being open source from the start doesn't mean your developers
                    must immediately take on the extra responsibilities of community
                    management. People often think that "open source" means "strangers
                    distracting us with questions", but that's
                    optional&nbsp;â&nbsp;it's something you might do down the road,
                    if and when it makes sense for your project. It's under your control.
                    There are still major advantages to be had by running the project out
                    in open, publicly-visible forums from the beginning. Conversely, the
                    longer the project is run closed-source, the more difficult it will be
                    to open up later.</p>

                <p>I think there's one underlying cause for this:</p>

                <p>At each step in a project, programmers face a choice: to do that
                    step in a manner compatible with a hypothetical future open-sourcing,
                    or do it in a manner incompatible with open-sourcing. And every time
                    they choose the latter, the project gets just a little bit harder to
                    open source.</p>

                <p>The crucial thing is, they can't help choosing the latter
                    occasionally&nbsp;â&nbsp;all the pressures of development propel
                    them that way. It's very difficult to give a future event the same
                    present-day weight as, say, fixing the incoming bugs reported by the
                    testers, or finishing that feature the customer just added to the
                    spec. Also, programmers struggling to stay on budget will inevitably
                    cut corners here and there (in Ward Cunningham's phrase, they will
                    incur "<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" target="_top">technical
                        debt</a>"), with the intention of cleaning it up
                    later.</p>

                <p>Thus, when it's time to open source, you'll suddenly find there
                    are things like:</p>

                <div class="itemizedlist">

                <p>The problem isn't just the work of doing the cleanups; it's the
                    extra decision-making they sometimes require. For example, if
                    sensitive material was checked into the code repository in the past,
                    your team now faces a choice between cleaning it out of the historical
                    revisions entirely, so you can open source the entire (sanitized)
                    history, or just cleaning up the latest revision and open-sourcing
                    from that (sometimes called a "top-skim"). Neither method is wrong or
                    right&nbsp;â&nbsp;and that's the problem: now you've got one
                    more discussion to have and one more decision to make. In some
                    projects, that decision gets made and reversed several times before
                    the final release. The thrashing itself is part of the cost.</p>

                    <div class="titlepage">

                    </div>
                    <p>The other problem with opening up a developed code base is that
                        it creates a needlessly large exposure event. Whatever issues there
                        may be in the code (modularity corner-cutting, security
                        vulnerabilities, etc), they are all exposed to public scrutiny at
                        once&nbsp;â&nbsp;the open-sourcing event becomes an opportunity
                        for the technical blogosphere to pounce on the code and see what they
                        can find.</p>

                    <p>Contrast that with the scenario where development was done in
                        the open from the beginning: code changes come in one at a time, so
                        problems are handled as they come up (and are often caught sooner,
                        since there are more eyeballs on the code). Because changes reach the
                        public at a low, continuous rate of exposure, no one blames your
                        development team for the occasional corner-cutting or flawed code
                        checkin. Everyone's been there, after all; these tradeoffs are
                        inevitable in real-world development. As long as the technical debt
                        is properly recorded in "FIXME" comments and bug reports, and any
                        security issues are addressed promptly, it's fine. Yet if those same
                        issues were to appear suddenly all at once, unsympathetic observers
                        may jump on the aggregate exposure in a way they never would have if
                        the issues had come up piecemeal in the normal course of
                        development.</p>

                    <p>(These concerns apply even more strongly to government software
                        projects; see <a class="xref" href="#starting-open-for-govs"
                                         title="Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects">the
                            section called âBeing Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government
                            Projectsâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#governments-and-open-source"

                            âGovernments and Open Sourceâ</a></span>.)</p></div>
                <p>The good news is that these are all unforced errors. A project
                    incurs little extra cost by avoiding them in the simplest way
                    possible: by running in the open from Day One.</p>

                <p>"In the open" means the following things are publicly
                    accessible, in standard formats, from the first day of the project:
                    the code repository, bug tracker, design documents, user
                    documentation, wiki, and developer discussion forums. It also means
                    the code and documentation are placed under an open source license, of
                    course. It also means your team's day-to-day work takes place in the
                    publicly visible area.</p>

                <p>"In the open" does not have to mean: allowing strangers to check
                    code into your repository (they're free to copy it into their own
                    repository, if they want, and work with it there); allowing anyone to
                    file bug reports in your tracker (you're free to choose your own QA
                    process, and if allowing reports from strangers doesn't help you, you
                    don't have to do it); reading and responding to every bug report
                    filed, even if you do allow strangers to file; responding to every
                    question people ask in the forums (even if you moderate them through);
                    reviewing every patch or suggestion posted, when doing so may cost
                    valuable development time; etc.</p>

                <p>One way to think of it is that you're open sourcing your code,
                    not your time. One of those resources is infinitely replicable, the
                    other is not. You'll have to determine the point at which engaging
                    with outside users and developers makes sense for your project. In
                    the long run it usually does, and most of this book is about how to do
                    it effectively. But it's still under your control. Developing in the
                    open does not change this, it just ensures that everything done in the
                    project is, by definition, done in a way that's compatible with being
                    open source.</p></div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>As per <a class="xref" href="#be-open-from-day-one" title="Be Open From Day One">the section called âBe
                Open From Day Oneâ</a>, it's best to
                avoid being in the situation of opening up a closed project in the
                first place; just start the project in the open if you can. But if
                it's too late for that, and you find yourself opening up an existing
                project that already has active developers accustomed to working in a
                closed-source environment, there are certain common issues that tend
                to arise. You can save a lot of time and trouble if you are prepared
                for them.</p>

            <p>Some of these issues are essentially
                mechanical&nbsp;â&nbsp;indeed, <a class="ulink" href="be-open-from-day-one" target="_top">be-open-from-day-one</a>
                can serve as a checklist of sorts. For
                example, if your code depends on proprietary libraries that are not
                part of the standard distribution of your target operating system(s),
                you will need to find open source replacements; if there is
                confidential content&nbsp;â&nbsp;e.g., unpublishable comments,
                passwords or site-specific configuration information that cannot
                easily be changed, confidential data belonging to third parties,
                etc&nbsp;â&nbsp;in the project's version control history, then
                you may have to release a "top-skim" version, that is, restart the
                version history afresh from the current version as of the moment you
                open source the code; and so on.</p>

            <p>But there can be social and managerial issues too, and they are
                often more significant in the long run than the mere mechanical
                concerns. You will need to make sure everyone on the development team
                understands that a big change is comingâand make sure that you
                understand how it's going to feel from their point of view.</p>

            <p>Try to imagine how the situation looks to them: formerly, all
                code and design decisions were made with a group of other programmers
                who knew the software more or less equally well, who all received the
                same pressures from the same management, and who all know each others'
                strengths and weaknesses. Now you're asking them to expose their code
                to the scrutiny of random strangers, who will form judgements based
                only on the code, with no awareness of what business pressures may
                have forced certain decisions. These strangers will ask lots of
                questions, questions that jolt the existing developers into realizing
                that the documentation they slaved so hard over is
                <span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> inadequate (this is inevitable). To top it
                all off, the newcomers are unknown, faceless entities. If one of your
                developers already feels insecure about his skills, imagine how that
                will be exacerbated when newcomers point out flaws in code he wrote,
                and worse, do so in front of his colleagues. Unless you have a team
                of perfect coders, this is unavoidableâin fact, it will probably
                happen to all of them at first. This is not because they're bad
                programmers; it's just that any program above a certain size has bugs,
                and peer review will spot some of those bugs (see
                <a class="xref" href="#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the section called
                    âPractice Conspicuous Code Reviewâ</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>). At the same time, the newcomers
                themselves won't be subject to much peer review at first, since they
                can't contribute code until they're more familiar with the project.
                To your developers, it may feel like all the criticism is incoming,
                never outgoing. Thus, there is the danger of a siege mentality taking
                hold among the old hands.</p>

            <p>The best way to prevent this is to warn everyone about what's
                coming, explain it, tell them that the initial discomfort is perfectly
                normal, and reassure them that it's going to get better. Some of
                these warnings should take place privately, before the project is
                opened. But you may also find it helpful to remind people on the
                public lists that this is a new way of development for the project,
                and that it will take some time to adjust. The very best thing you
                can do is lead by example. If you don't see your developers answering
                enough newbie questions, then just telling them to answer more isn't
                going to help. They may not have a good sense of what warrants a
                response and what doesn't yet, or it could be that they don't have a
                feel for how to prioritize coding work against the new burden of
                external communications. The way to get them to participate is to
                participate yourself. Be on the public mailing lists, and make sure
                to answer some questions there. When you don't have the
                expertise to field a question, then visibly hand it off to a developer
                who doesâand watch to make sure he follows up with an answer,
                or at least a response. It will naturally be tempting for the
                longtime developers to lapse into private discussions, since that's
                what they're used to. Make sure you're subscribed to the internal
                mailing lists on which this might happen, so you can ask that such
                discussions be moved to the public lists right away.</p>

            <p>If you expect the newly-public project to start involving
                developers who are not paid directly for their
                work&nbsp;â&nbsp;and there are usually at least a few such
                developers on most successful open source
                projects&nbsp;â&nbsp;see <a class="xref" href="#money" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Money">Chapter&nbsp;5,

            <p>Once the project is presentableânot perfect, just
                presentableâyou're ready to announce it to the world.</p>

            <p>This is a simpler process than you might expect. There are two kinds
                of forums for making announcements: generic forums that display a
                constant stream of new project announcements, and topic-specific
                forums where your project would be appropriate news.</p>

            <p>The most useful generic place is probably <a class="ulink" href="http://freecode.com/" target="_top">freecode.com</a>&nbsp;â&nbsp;just
                click on the
                <span class="guimenuitem">Submit new project</span> link in the top
                navigation bar. Freecode's list of recent new projects is embedded on
                the front page of the popular <a class="ulink" href="http://slashdot.org/"
                                                 target="_top">Slashdot.org</a>, which means someone interested is
                likely to
                notice it and help spread the news by word of mouth. (Note that
                Freecode was known as Freshmeat.net until it was renamed in Oct 2011.)
                You might also want to register your project at <a class="ulink" href="http://OhLoh.net/" target="_top">OhLoh.net</a>,
                which is the closest thing
                there is to an integrated global database of free software projects
                and their contributors. (Some projects also successfully climb the
                word-of-mouth / upvote tree to the point where they are featured on
                the front page of <a class="ulink" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_top">news.ycombinator.com</a>,
                one of the subreddit forums related to
                <a class="ulink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/" target="_top">reddit.com/r/technology</a>,
                or some similarly popular public
                page. While it's good news for your project if you can get mentioned
                in a place like that, I hesitate to contribute to the marketing arms
                race by suggesting any concrete steps to accomplish this. Use your
                judgement and try not to spam.)</p>

            <p>The topic-specific forums are probably where you'll get the most
                interest. Think about mailing lists or web forums where an
                announcement of your project would be on-topic and of
                interest&nbsp;â&nbsp;you might already be a member of some of
                them&nbsp;â&nbsp;and post there. Be careful to make exactly
                <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> post per forum, and to direct people to your
                project's own discussion areas for follow-up discussion (when posting
                by email, you can do this by setting the
                <code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> header). Your announcement should
                be short and get right to the point, and the Subject line should make
                it clear that it is an announcement of a new project:</p><pre class="screen">To: discuss@some.forum.about.search.indexers

                for advice on announcing
                subsequent releases and other project events.)</p>

            <p>There is an ongoing debate in the free software world about
                whether it is necessary to begin with running code, or whether a
                project can benefit from being announced even during the
                design/discussion stage. I used to think starting with running code
                was crucial, that it was what separated successful projects from toys,
                and that serious developers would only be attracted to software that
                already does something concrete.</p>

            <p>This turned out not to be the case. In the Subversion project,
                we started with a design document, a core of interested and
                well-connected developers, a lot of fanfare, and
                <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> running code at all. To my complete surprise,
                the project acquired active participants right from the beginning, and
                by the time we did have something running, there were quite a few
                volunteer developers already deeply involved. Subversion is not the
                only example; the Mozilla project was also launched without running
                code, and is now a successful and popular web browser.</p>

            <p>On the evidence of this and other examples, I have to back away
                from the assertion that running code is absolutely necessary for
                launching a project. Running code is still the best foundation for
                success, and a good rule of thumb would be to wait until you have it
                before announcing your project<sup>[<a name="idp5741392" href="#ftn.idp5741392" class="footnote">24</a>]</sup>.
                However, there may be circumstances where
                announcing earlier makes sense. I do think that at least a
                well-developed design document, or else some sort of code framework,
                is necessaryâof course it may be revised based on public
                feedback, but there has to be something concrete, something more
                tangible than just good intentions, for people to sink their teeth
                into.</p>

            <p>Whenever you announce, don't expect a horde of volunteers to
                join the project immediately afterward. Usually, the result of
                announcing is that you get a few casual inquiries, a few more people
                join your mailing lists, and aside from that, everything continues
                pretty much as before. But over time, you will notice a gradual
                increase in participation from both new code contributors and users.
                Announcement is merely the planting of a seed. It can take a long
                time for the news to spread. If the project consistently rewards
                those who get involved, the news <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> spread,
                though, because people want to share when they've found something
                good. If all goes well, the dynamics of exponential communications
                networks will slowly transform the project into a complex community,
                where you don't necessarily know everyone's name and can no longer
                follow every single conversation. The next chapters are about working
                in that environment.</p></div>

                didn't manage to get gnome.com or gnome.net,

                it's fine. That's usually the first one people look for when they're
                seeking the open source project of that name. If they couldn't get
                "gnome.org" itself, a typical solution would be to get
                "gnomeproject.org" instead, and many projects solve the problem that
                way.</p></div>

                "tweets"&nbsp;â&nbsp;on both Identi.ca and Twitter. While the
                total number of people on Identi.ca is far smaller than on Twitter,
                the percentage of them that are likely to be interested in news about
                an open source project is far higher, at least as of this writing in
                2013 and for some years preceding that.</p></div>

                are actually
                some minor differences between the sets of approved licenses, but
                they are not significant for our purposes&nbsp;â&nbsp;or
                indeed for most practical purposes. In some cases, one or the other
                organization has simply not gotten around to considering a given
                license, usually a license that is not widely-used anyway. And
                apparently (so I'm told) there historically was a license that at
                least one of the organizations, and possibly both, agreed fit one
                definition but not the other. Whenever I try to get the details on
                this, though, I seem to get a different answer as to what that
                license was, except that the license named is always one that was
                not many people used anyway. So today, for any license you are
                likely to be using, the terms "OSI-approved" and "FSF-approved" can
                be treated as implying each other.</p></div>

            <p>Free software projects rely on technologies that support the
                selective capture and integration of information. The more skilled
                you are at using these technologies, and at persuading others to use
                them, the more successful your project will be.</p>

            <p>This only becomes
                more true as the project grows. Good information management is what
                prevents open source projects from collapsing under the weight of
                Brooks' Law<sup>[<a name="idp6036752" href="#ftn.idp6036752" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup>,
                which states that adding manpower to a late software project makes it
                later. Fred Brooks observed that the complexity of communications in
                a project
                increases as the <span class="emphasis"><em>square</em></span> of the number of
                participants. When only a few people are involved, everyone can easily
                talk to everyone else, but when hundreds of people are involved, it is
                no longer possible for each person to remain constantly aware of what
                everyone else is doing. If good free software project management is
                about making everyone feel like they're all working together in the
                same room, the obvious question is: what happens when everyone in a
                crowded room tries to talk at once?</p>

            <p>This problem is not new. In non-metaphorical crowded rooms, the
                solution is <em class="firstterm">parliamentary procedure</em>: formal
                guidelines for how to have real-time discussions in large groups, how
                to make sure important dissents are not lost in floods of "me-too"
                comments, how to form subcommittees, how to recognize and record when
                decisions
                are made, etc. An important part of parliamentary procedure is
                specifying how the group interacts with its information management
                system. Some remarks are made "for the record", others are not. The
                record itself is subject to direct manipulation, and is understood to
                be not a literal transcript of what occurred, but a representation of
                what the group is willing to <span class="emphasis"><em>agree</em></span> occurred. The
                record is not monolithic, but takes different forms for different
                purposes. It comprises the minutes of individual meetings, the
                complete collection of all minutes of all meetings, summaries, agendas
                and their annotations, committee reports, reports from correspondents
                not present, lists of action items, etc.</p>

            <p>Because the Internet is not really a room, we don't have to
                worry about replicating those parts of parliamentary procedure that
                keep some people quiet while others are speaking. But when it comes
                to information management techniques, well-run open source projects
                are parliamentary procedure on steroids. Since almost all
                communication in open source projects happens in writing, elaborate
                systems have evolved for routing and labeling data appropriately, for
                minimizing repetitions so as to avoid spurious divergences, for
                storing and retrieving data, for correcting bad or obsolete
                information, and for associating disparate bits of information with
                each other as new connections are observed. Active participants in
                open source projects internalize many of these techniques, and will
                often perform complex manual tasks to ensure that information is
                routed correctly. But the whole endeavor ultimately depends on
                sophisticated software support. As much as possible, the
                communications media themselves should do the routing, labeling, and
                recording, and should make the information available to humans in the
                most convenient way possible. In practice, of course, humans will
                still need to intervene at many points in the process, and it's
                important that the software make such interventions convenient too.
                But in general, if the humans take care to label and route information
                accurately on its first entry into the system, then the software
                should be configured to make as much use of that metadata as
                possible.</p>

            <p>The advice in this chapter is intensely practical, based on
                experiences with specific software and usage patterns. But the point
                is not just to teach a particular collection of techniques. It is
                also to demonstrate, by means of many small examples, the overall
                attitude that will best encourage good information management in your
                project. This attitude will involve a combination of technical skills
                and people skills. The technical skills are essential because
                information management software always requires configuration, plus a
                certain amount of ongoing maintenance and tweaking as new needs arise
                (for example, see the discussion of how to handle project growth in
                <a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">the section called
                    âPre-Filtering the Bug Trackerâ</a><span> later in
this chapter</span>). The people skills are necessary
                because the human community also requires maintenance: it's not always
                immediately obvious how to use these tools to full advantage, and in
                some cases projects have conflicting conventions (for example, see the
                discussion of setting <code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> headers on
                outgoing mailing list posts, in <a class="xref" href="#message-forums"
                                                   title="Mailing Lists / Message Forums">the section called âMailing
                    Lists / Message Forumsâ</a>).
                Everyone involved with the project will need to be encouraged, at the
                right times and in the right ways, to do their part to keep the
                project's information well organized. The more involved the
                contributor, the more complex and specialized the techniques she can
                be expected to learn.</p>

            <p>Information management has no cut-and-dried solution. There are
                too many variables. You may finally get everything configured just
                the way you want it, and have most of the community participating, but
                then project growth will make some of those practices unscalable. Or
                project growth may stabilize, and the developer and user communities
                settle into a comfortable relationship with the technical
                infrastructure, but then someone will come along and invent a whole
                new information management service, and pretty soon newcomers will be
                asking why your project doesn't use itâfor example, this
                happened to a lot of free software projects that predate the invention
                of the wiki (see <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a>),
                and more recently has been
                happening to projects whose workflows were developed before the rise
                of GitHub PRs (see <a class="xref" href="#pull-requests" title="Pull requests">the section called âPull
                    requestsâ</a>) as the canonical
                way to package proposed contributions. Many infrastructure questions
                are matters of judgement, involving tradeoffs between the convenience
                of those producing information and the convenience of those consuming
                it, or between the time required to configure information management
                software and the benefit it brings to the project.</p>

            <p>Beware of the temptation to over-automate, that is, to automate
                things that really require human attention. Technical infrastructure
                is important, but what makes a free software project work is
                careâand intelligent expression of that careâby the humans
                involved. The technical infrastructure is mainly about giving humans
                easy ways to apply care.</p></div>

            <p>Each tool in this set addresses a distinct need, but their functions
                are also interrelated, and the tools must be made to work together.
                Below we will examine how they can do so, and more importantly, how to
                get people to use them.</p>

            <p>You may be able to avoid a lot of the headache of choosing and
                configuring many of these tools by using a <em class="firstterm">canned

            <p><span class="emphasis"><em>possv2 24 March 2013: If you're reading this note, then
                you've encountered this chapter while it's undergoing substantial
                revision; see <a class="ulink" href="http://producingoss.com/v2.html" target="_top">producingoss.com/v2.html</a>
                for details.</em></span></p>

            <p>For our purposes, <span class="emphasis"><em>the web site</em></span> means web
                pages devoted to helping people participate in the project as
                developers, documenters, etc. Note that this is different from the
                main user-facing web site. In many projects, users have different
                needs and often (statistically speaking) a different mentality from
                the developers. The kinds of web pages most helpful to users are not
                necessarily the same as those helpful for
                developers&nbsp;â&nbsp;don't try to make a "one size fits all"
                web site just to save some writing and maintenance effort: you'll end
                up with a site that is not quite right for either audience.</p>

            <p>The two types of sites should cross-link, of course, and in
                particular it's important that the user-oriented site have, tucked a
                way in a corner somewhere, a clear link to the developers' site, since
                most new developers will start out at the user-facing pages and look
                for a path from there to the developers' area.</p>

            <p>An example may make this clearer. As of this writing in
                November 2013, the office suite LibreOffice has its main user-oriented
                web site at <a class="ulink" href="https://libreoffice.org/" target="_top">libreoffice.org</a>, as you'd
                expect. If you were a user wanting
                to download and install LibreOffice, you'd start there, go straight to
                the "Download" link, and so on. But if you were a developer looking
                to (say) fix a bug in LibreOffice, you might
                <span class="emphasis"><em>start</em></span> at <a class="ulink" href="https://libreoffice.org/"
                                                                   target="_top">libreoffice.org</a>, but you'd be
                looking for a link that says
                something like "Developers", or "Development", or "Get
                Involved"&nbsp;â&nbsp;in other words, you'd be looking for the
                gateway to the development area.</p>

            <p>In the case of LibreOffice, as with some other large projects,
                they actually have a couple of different gateways. There's one link
                that says <a class="ulink" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/get-involved/" target="_top">"Get&nbsp;Involved"</a>,
                and another that says <a class="ulink" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/developers/" target="_top">"Developers"</a>.
                The "Get Involved" page is aimed at the broadest possible range of
                potential contributors: developers, yes, but also documenters,
                quality-assurance testers, marketing volunteers, web infrastructure
                volunteers, financial or in-kind donors, interface designers, support
                forum volunteers, etc. This frees up the "Developers" page to target
                the rather narrower audience of programmers who want to get involved
                in improving the LibreOffice code. The set of links and short
                descriptions provided on both pages is admirably clear and concise:
                you can tell immediately from looking whether you're in the right
                place for what you want do, and if so what the next thing to click on
                is. The "Development" page gives some information about where to find
                the code, how to contact the other developers, how to file bugs, and
                things like that, but most importantly it points to what most seasoned
                open source contributors would instantly recognize as the

            <p>This division into two contributor-facing gateways, one for all
                kinds of contributions and another for coders specifically, is
                probably right for a large, multi-faceted project like LibreOffice.
                You'll have to use your judgement as to whether that kind of
                subdivision is appropriate for your project; at least at the
                beginning, it probably isn't. It's better to start with one unified
                contributor gateway, aimed at all the types of contributors you
                expect, and if that page ever gets large enough or complex enough to
                feel unwieldy&nbsp;â&nbsp;listen carefully for complaints about
                it, since you and other long-time participants will be naturally
                desensitized to weaknesses in introductory
                pages!&nbsp;â&nbsp;then you can divide it up however seems
                best.</p>

            <p>From a technical point of view there is not much to say about
                setting up the project web site. Configuring a web server and writing
                web pages are fairly simple tasks, and most of the important things to
                say about layout and arrangement were covered in the previous chapter.
                The web site's main function is to present a clear and welcoming
                overview of the project, and to bind together the other tools (the
                version control system, bug tracker, etc.). If you don't have the
                expertise to set up a web server yourself, it's usually not hard to
                find someone who does and is willing to help out. Nonetheless, to
                save time and effort, people often prefer to use one of the canned
                hosting sites.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Canned Hosting">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting"></a>Canned Hosting</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>A <em class="firstterm">canned hosting</em> site is an online
                    service that offers some or all of the online collaboration tools
                    needed to run a free software project. At a minimal, a canned hosting
                    site offers public version control repositories and bug tracking; most
                    also offer wiki space, many offer mailing list hosting too, and some
                    offer continuous integration testing and other
                    services.<sup>[<a name="idp6125200" href="#ftn.idp6125200" class="footnote">26</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>There are two main advantages to using a canned site. The first
                    is server capacity and bandwidth: their servers are hefty boxes
                    sitting on really fat pipes. No matter how successful your project
                    gets, you're not going to run out of disk space or swamp the network
                    connection. The second advantage is simplicity. They have already
                    chosen a bug tracker, a version control system, perhaps discussion
                    forum software, and everything else you need to run a project.
                    They've configured the tools, arranged single-sign-on authentication
                    where appropriate, are taking care of backups for all the data stored
                    in the tools, etc. You don't need to make many decisions. All you
                    have to do is fill in a registration form, press a button, and
                    suddenly you've got a project development web site.</p>

                <p>These are pretty significant benefits. The disadvantage, of
                    course, is that you must accept <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> choices and
                    configurations, even if something different would be better for your
                    project. Usually canned sites are adjustable within certain narrow
                    parameters, but you will never get the fine-grained control you would
                    have if you set up the site yourself and had full administrative
                    access to the server.</p>

                <p>A perfect example of this is the handling of generated files.
                    Certain project web pages may be generated filesâfor example,
                    there are systems for keeping FAQ data in an easy-to-edit master
                    format, from which HTML, PDF, and other presentation formats can be
                    generated. As explained in
                    <a class="xref" href="#version-everything" title="Version everything">the section called âVersion
                        everythingâ</a><span>
earlier in this chapter</span>,
                    you wouldn't want to version the generated formats, only the master
                    file. But when your web site is hosted on someone else's server, it
                    may be difficult to set up a custom hook to regenerate the online
                    HTML version of the FAQ whenever the master file is changed.</p>

                <p>If you choose a canned site, try to leave open the option of
                    switching to a different site later, by using a custom domain name as the
                    project's development home address. You can forward that URL to the
                    canned site, or have a fully customized development home page at the
                    main URL and link to the canned site for specific functionality. Just
                    try to arrange things such that if you later decide to use a different
                    hosting solution, the project's main address doesn't need to
                    change.</p>

                <p>And if you're not sure whether to use canned hosting, then you
                    should probably use canned hosting. These sites have integrated their
                    services in myriad ways (just one example: if a commit mentions a bug
                    ticket number using a certain format, then people browsing that commit
                    later will find that it automatically links to that ticket), ways that
                    would be laborious for you to reproduce, especially if it's your first
                    time running an open source project. The universe of possible
                    configurations of collaboration tools is vast and complex, but the
                    same set of choices has faced everyone running an open source project
                    and there are some settled solutions now. Each of the canned hosting
                    sites implements a reasonable subset of that solution space, and
                    unless you have reason to believe you can do better, your project will
                    probably run best just using one of those sites.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>There are now so many sites providing free-of-charge canned
                        hosting for projects released under open source licenses that there is
                        not space here to review the field.</p>

                    <p>So I'll make this easy:</p>

                    <p>If you don't know what to choose, then choose <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/"
                                                                        target="_top">GitHub</a>. It's by far the most
                        popular and appears set to stay that way for some years to come. It
                        has a good set of features and integrations. Many developers are
                        already familiar with GitHub and have an account there. It has an
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://develop.github.com/" target="_top">API</a> for interacting
                        programmatically with project resources, and while it does not
                        currently offer mailing lists, there are plenty of other places you
                        can provision those, such as <a class="ulink" href="https://discourse.org/" target="_top">discourse.org</a>
                        and <a class="ulink" href="http://groups.google.com/" target="_top">Google Groups</a>.</p>

                    <p>If you're not convinced by GitHub (for example because your
                        project uses, say, Mercurial instead of Git for version control), but
                        you aren't sure where to host, take a look at Wikipedia's thorough
                        <a class="ulink"
                           href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities"
                           target="_top">comparison of open source software hosting facilities</a>; it's
                        the first place to look for up-to-date, comprehensive information on
                        open source project hosting options.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Hosting on fully open source infrastructure">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="hosting-on-freedom"></a>Hosting on fully open source
                                infrastructure</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Although all the canned hosting sites use plenty of free
                        software in their stack, most of them also wrote some proprietary
                        code to glue it all together. In these cases the hosting environment
                        itself is not fully open source, and thus cannot be easily reproduced
                        by others. For example, while Git itself is free software, GitHub is
                        a hosted service running partly with proprietary
                        software&nbsp;â&nbsp;if you leave GitHub, you can't take a copy
                        of their infrastructure with you, at least not all of it.</p>

                    <p>Some projects would prefer a canned hosting site that runs an
                        entirely free software infrastructure and that could, in theory, be
                        reproduced independently were that ever to become necessary.
                        Fortunately, there are a few such sites. As of mid-2015, <a class="ulink"
                                                                                    href="http://phacility.com"
                                                                                    target="_top">phacility.com</a>
                        offers low-cost
                        project hosting in <a class="ulink" href="http://phabricator.org/" target="_top">Phabricator</a>,
                        a fully open source web platform for open-source
                        style collaboration.</p>

                    <p>There is also <a class="ulink" href="http://gitlab.com/" target="_top">GitLab</a>,
                        which until recently was fully open source. However, they now seem to
                        offer an open source edition for self-hosting and an "enterprise
                        edition" that they host and that has a few features the open source
                        edition doesn't have. Unfortunately, GitLab.com doesn't currently
                        seem to offer a hosting package based on the strictly open source
                        edition, which is too bad, because that would be the best choice for
                        an open source project that wants to outsource hosting while
                        preserving its commitment, both philosophical and utilitarian, to
                        software freedom.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, any service that offers hosting of the <a class="ulink" href="http://redmine.org/"
                                                                              target="_top">Redmine</a> or <a
                            class="ulink" href="http://trac.edgewall.org" target="_top">Trac</a> code collaboration
                        platforms effectively offers fully freedom-preserving project hosting,
                        because those platforms include most of the features needed to run an
                        open source project. Some companies offer that kind of commercial
                        platform hosting with a zero-cost or very cheap rate for open source
                        projects.</p>

                    <p>Should you host your project on fully open source
                        infrastructure? While it would be ideal, from the free software
                        philosophical perspective, to have access to all the code that runs
                        the site, I cannot say I've seen any evidence that hosting or not
                        hosting on that kind of site has any effect on a project's success.
                        The vast majority of developers who work on free software projects are
                        willing to participate through a non-free hosting platform when that's
                        what the project is using.</p>

                    <p>In my opinion, the crucial thing is to be able to interact with
                        project data in automatable ways, and to have a way to export the
                        data. A site that meets these criteria can never truly lock you in,
                        and will even be somewhat extensible, via its programmatic interface.
                        While there is some value in having all the code that runs a hosting
                        site available under open source terms, in practice the demands of
                        actually deploying that code in a production environment are difficult
                        and sometimes prohibitive for most projects anyway. The largest of
                        these sites need multiple servers, customized networks, and full-time
                        staffs to keep them running; merely having the code would not be
                        sufficient to duplicate or "fork" them anyway. The main thing is just
                        to make sure your data isn't trapped.</p>

                    <p>Of course, all the above applies only to the servers of the
                        hosting site. Your project itself should never require participants
                        to run proprietary collaboration software on their own
                        machines.<sup>[<a name="idp6150112" href="#ftn.idp6150112" class="footnote">27</a>]</sup></p>

                    </div>
                    <p>A problem that is not strictly limited to the canned sites, but
                        is most often found there, is the over-requirement of user
                        registration to participate in various aspects of the project. The
                        proper degree of requirement is a bit of a judgement call. User
                        registration helps prevent spam, for one thing, and even if every
                        commit gets reviewed you still probably don't want anonymous strangers
                        pushing changes into your repository, for example.</p>

                    <p>But sometimes user registration ends up being required for tasks
                        that ought to be permitted to unregistered visitors, especially the
                        ability to file tickets in the bug tracker, and to comment on existing
                        tickets. By requiring a logged-in username for such actions, the
                        project raises the involvement bar for what should be quick,
                        convenient tasks. It also changes the demographics of who files bugs,
                        since those who take the trouble to set up a user account at the
                        project site are hardly a random sample even from among users who are
                        willing to file bugs (who in turn are already a biased subset of all
                        the project's users). Of course, one wants to be able to contact
                        someone who's entered data into the ticket tracker, but having a field
                        where she can enter her email address (if she wants to) is sufficient.
                        If a new user spots a bug and wants to report it, she'll only be
                        annoyed at having to fill out an account creation form before she can
                        enter the bug into the tracker. She may simply decide not to file the
                        bug at all.</p>

            <p>Discussion forums in which participants post and respond to
                messages are the bread and butter of project communications. For a
                long time these were mainly email-based discussion lists, but the
                distinction between Web-based forums and mailing lists is, thankfully,
                slowly disappearing. Services like <a class="ulink" href="https://groups.google.com/" target="_top">Google
                    Groups</a> (which is not
                itself open source) and <a class="ulink" href="http://Gmane.org/" target="_top">Gmane.org</a> (which is)
                have now established that
                cross-accessibility of message forums as mailing lists and vice versa
                is the minimum bar to meet, and modern discussion management systems
                like GroupServer and Sympa reflect this.</p>

            <p>Because of this nearly-completed unification between email lists
                and web-based forums<sup>[<a name="idp6160608" href="#ftn.idp6160608" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup>, I
                will
                use the terms <em class="firstterm">message&nbsp;forum</em> and
                <em class="firstterm">mailing&nbsp;list</em> more or less interchangeably.
                They refer to any kind of message-based forum where posts are linked
                together in threads (topics), people can subscribe, archives of past
                messages can be browsed, and the forum can be interacted with via
                email or via a web browser.</p>

            <p>If a user is exposed to any channel besides a project's web
                pages, it is most likely to be one of the project's message forums.
                But before she experiences the forum itself, she will experience the
                process of finding the right forums. Your project should
                have a prominently-placed description of all the available public
                forums, to give newcomers guidance in deciding which ones to browse or
                post to first. A typical such description might say something like
                this:</p><pre class="screen">  The mailing lists are the main day-to-day communication channels for
  the Scanley community.  You don't have to be subscribed to post to a
  list, but if it's your first time posting (whether you're subscribed
  or not), your message may be held in a moderation queue until a
  human moderator has a chance to confirm that the message is not spam.
  We're sorry for this delay; blame the spammers who make it necessary.

  Scanley has the following lists:

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">users&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    Discussion about using Scanley or programming with the Scanley
    API, suggestions of possible improvements, etc.  You can browse the
    users@ archives at <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to archive&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span> or subscribe here:
    <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">dev&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    Discussion about developing Scanley.  Maintainers and contributors
    are subscribed to this list.  You can browse the dev@ archives at
    <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to archive&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span> or subscribe here: <span
                    class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

    (Sometimes threads cross over between users@ and dev@, and
    Scanley's developers will often participate in discussions on both
    lists.  In general if you're unsure where a question or post
    should go, start it out on <code class="literal">users@</code>.  If it should be a
    development discussion, someone will suggest moving it over to
    <code class="literal">dev@</code>.)

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">announcements&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    This is a low-traffic, subscribe-only list.  The Scanley
    developers post announcements of new releases and occasional other
    news items of interest to the entire Scanley community here, but
    followup discussion takes place on users@ or dev@.
    <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">notifications&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    All code commit messages, bug tracker tickets, automated
    build/integration failures, etc, are sent to this list.  Most
    developers should subscribe: <span class="bold"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;link to subscribe&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>.

  There is also a non-public list you may need to send to, although
  only developers are subscribed:

  <span class="bold"><strong><code class="literal">security&nbsp;{_AT_}&nbsp;scanley.org</code></strong></span>:
    Where the Scanley project receives confidential reports of
    security vulnerabilities.  Of course, the report will be made
    public eventually, but only after a fix is released; see our
    security procedures page for more [...]

                <p>The point of the above list is really just to show that forum
                    management is a complex problem that has already been given a lot of
                    thought, and to some degree been solved. You don't need to become an
                    expert, but you will have to learn at least a little bit about
                    it, and you should expect list management to occupy your attention
                    from time to time in the course of running any free software project.
                    Below we'll examine a few of the most common issues.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Spam Prevention">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="spam-prevention"></a>Spam Prevention</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Between when this sentence is written and when it is published,
                        the Internet-wide spam problem will probably double in
                        severityâor at least it will feel that way. There was a time,
                        not so long ago, when one could run a mailing list without taking any
                        spam-prevention measures at all. The occasional stray post would
                        still show up, but infrequently enough to be only a low-level
                        annoyance. That era is gone forever. Today, a mailing list that
                        takes no spam prevention measures will quickly be submerged in junk
                        emails, to the point of unusability. Spam prevention is
                        mandatory.</p>

                    <p>We divide spam prevention into two categories: preventing spam
                        posts from appearing on your mailing lists, and preventing your
                        mailing list from being a source of new email addresses for spammers'
                        harvesters. The former is more important to your project, so we
                        examine it first.</p>

                    <div class="sect4" title="Filtering posts">
                        <div class="titlepage">
                            <div>
                                <div><h5 class="title"><a name="spam-filtering"></a>Filtering posts</h5></div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>There are three basic techniques for preventing spam posts, and
                            most mailing list software offers all three. They are best used in
                            tandem:</p>

                        <div class="orderedlist">
                            <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                                <li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Only auto-allow postings from
                                    list subscribers.</strong></span></p>

                                    <p>This is effective as far as it goes, and also
                                        involves very little administrative overhead, since it's
                                        usually just a matter of changing a setting in the mailing
                                        list software's configuration. But note that posts which
                                        aren't automatically approved must not be simply
                                        discarded. Instead, they should go into a moderation
                                        queue, for two reasons. First, you want to allow
                                        non-subscribers to post: a person with a question or
                                        suggestion should not need to subscribe to a mailing list
                                        just to ask a question there. Second, even
                                        subscribers may sometimes post from an address other than
                                        the one by which they're subscribed. Email addresses are
                                        not a reliable method of identifying people, and shouldn't
                                        be treated as such.</p></li>
                                <li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Filter posts through
                                    spam-detection software.</strong></span></p>

                                    <p>If the mailing list software makes it possible (most
                                        do), you can have posts filtered by spam-filtering
                                        software. Automatic spam-filtering is not perfect, and
                                        never will be, since there is a never-ending arms race
                                        between spammers and filter writers. However, it can
                                        greatly reduce the amount of spam that makes it through to the
                                        moderation queue, and since the longer that queue is the
                                        more time humans must spend examining it, any amount of
                                        automated filtering is beneficial.</p>

                                    <p>There is not space here for detailed instructions
                                        on setting up spam filters. You will have to consult
                                        your mailing list software's documentation for that (see
                                        <a class="xref" href="#mailing-list-software">the section called âMailing List /
                                            Message Forum Softwareâ</a><span> later in this chapter</span>). List
                                        software often comes with some built-in spam prevention
                                        features, but you may want to add some third-party
                                        filters. I've had good experiences with SpamAssassin
                                        (<a class="ulink" href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/" target="_top">spamassassin.apache.org</a>)
                                        and SpamProbe
                                        (<a class="ulink" href="http://spamprobe.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">spamprobe.sourceforge.net</a>),
                                        but this
                                        is not a comment on the many other open source spam
                                        filters out there, some of which are apparently also quite
                                        good. I just happen to have used those two myself and
                                        been satisfied with them.</p></li>

                                        virtue of being from a list subscriber, and which make it
                                        through the spam filtering software, if any, the last stage
                                        is <em class="firstterm">moderation</em>: the mail is routed
                                        to a special holding area, where a human examines it and
                                        confirms or rejects it.</p>

                                    <p>Confirming a post usually takes one of two forms:
                                        you can accept the sender's post just this once, or you
                                        can tell the system to allow this and all future posts
                                        from the same sender. You almost always want to do the
                                        latter, in order to reduce the future moderation
                                        burden&nbsp;â&nbsp;after all, someone who has made a
                                        valid post to a forum is unlikely to suddenly turn into a
                                        spammer later.</p>

                                    <p>Rejecting is done by either marking the item to be
                                        discarded, or by explicitly telling the system the message
                                        was spam so the system can improve its ability to
                                        recognize future spams. Sometimes
                                        you also have the option to automatically discard future
                                        mails from the same sender without them ever being held in
                                        the moderation queue, but there is rarely any point doing
                                        this, since spammers don't send from the same address
                                        twice anyway.</p>

                                    <p>Oddly, most message-forum systems have not yet given
                                        the moderation queue administrative interface the
                                        attention it deserves, considering how common the task is,
                                        so moderation often still requires more clicks and UI
                                        gestures than it should. I hope this situation will
                                        improve in the future. In the meantime, perhaps knowing
                                        you're not alone in your frustration will temper your
                                        disappointment somewhat.</p></li>

                        <p>Be sure to use moderation <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for
                            filtering out spams, and perhaps for clearly off-topic messages such
                            as when someone accidentally posts to the wrong mailing list.
                            Although the moderation system may give you a way to respond directly
                            to the sender, you should never use that method to answer questions
                            that really belong on the mailing list itself, even if you know the
                            answer off the top of your head. To do so would deprive the project's
                            community of an accurate picture of what sorts of questions people are
                            asking, and deprive people of a chance to answer questions themselves
                            and/or see answers from others. Mailing list moderation is strictly
                            about keeping the list free of spam and of wildly off-topic emails,
                            nothing more.</p></div>

                        <p>or some similarly obvious (to a human) encoding. Since spam
                            address harvesters often work by crawling through web
                            pagesâincluding your mailing list's online archivesâand
                            looking for sequences containing "@", encoding the addresses is a way
                            of making people's email addresses invisible or useless to spammers.
                            This does nothing to prevent spam from being sent to the mailing list
                            itself, of course, but it does avoid increasing the amount of spam
                            sent directly to list users' personal addresses.</p>

                        <p>Address hiding can be controversial. Some people like it a lot,
                            and will be surprised if your archives don't do it automatically.
                            Other people think it's too much of an inconvenience (because humans
                            also have to translate the addresses back before using them).
                            Sometimes people assert that it's ineffective, because a harvester
                            could in theory compensate for any consistent encoding pattern.
                            However, note that there is empirical evidence that address hiding
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> effective; see <a class="ulink"
                                                                                        href="http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml"
                                                                                        target="_top">cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml</a>.

                        <p>Ideally, the list management software would leave the choice up
                            to each individual subscriber, either through a special yes/no header
                            or a setting in that subscriber's list account preferences. However,
                            I don't know of any software which offers per-subscriber or per-post
                            choice in the matter, so for now the list manager must make a decision
                            for everyone (assuming the archiver offers the feature at all, which
                            is not always the case). For what it's worth, I lean toward turning
                            address hiding on. Some people are very careful to avoid posting
                            their email addresses on web pages or anywhere else a spam harvester
                            might see it, and they would be disappointed to have all that care
                            thrown away by a mailing list archive; meanwhile, the inconvenience
                            address hiding imposes on archive users is very slight, since it's
                            trivial to transform an obscured address back to a valid one if you
                            need to reach the person. But keep in mind that, in the end, it's
                            still an arms race: by the time you read this, harvesters might well
                            have evolved to the point where they can recognize most common forms
                            of hiding, and we'll have to think of something else.</p></div>

                    <p>When interacting with the forum by email, subscribers often want
                        to put mails from the list into a project-specific folder, separate
                        from their other mail. Their mail reading software can do this
                        automatically by examining the mail's <em class="firstterm">headers</em>.
                        The headers are the fields at the top of the mail that indicate the
                        sender, recipient, subject, date, and various other things about the
                        message. Certain headers are well known and are effectively
                        mandatory:</p><pre class="screen">From: ...
To: ...
Subject: ...
Date: ...
</pre>
                    <p>Others are optional, though still quite standard. For example,
                        emails are not strictly required to have the</p><pre class="screen">Reply-to: sender@email.address.here
</pre>
                    <p>header, but most do, because it gives recipients a foolproof way
                        to reach the author (it is especially useful when the author had to
                        send from an address other than the one to which replies should be
                        directed).</p>

                    <p>Some mail reading software offers an easy-to-use interface for
                        filing mails based on patterns in the Subject header. This leads
                        people to request that the mailing list add an automatic prefix to all
                        Subjects, so they can set their readers to look for that prefix and
                        automatically file the mails in the right folder. The idea is that
                        the original author would write:</p><pre class="screen">Subject: Making the 2.5 release.
</pre>
                    <p>but the mail would show up on the list looking like this:</p><pre class="screen">Subject: [Scanley Discuss] Making the 2.5 release.
</pre>
                    <p>Although most list management software offers the option to do
                        this, you may decide against turning the option on. The problem
                        it solves can often be solved in less obtrusive ways (see below), and
                        there is a cost to eating space in the Subject field. Experienced
                        mailing list users typically scan the Subjects of the day's incoming
                        list mail to decide what to read and/or respond to. Prepending the
                        list's name to the Subject can push the right side of the Subject off
                        the screen, rendering it invisible. This obscures information that
                        people depend on to decide what mails to open, thus reducing the
                        overall functionality of the mailing list for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Instead of munging the Subject header, your project could take
                        advantage of the other standard headers, starting with the To header,
                        which should say the mailing list's address:</p><pre class="screen">To: &lt;discuss@lists.example.org&gt;
</pre>
                    <p>Any mail reader that can filter on Subject should be able to filter on
                        To just as easily.</p>

                    <p>There are a few other optional-but-standard headers expected for
                        mailing lists; they are sometimes not displayed by most mailreader
                        software, but they are present nonetheless. Filtering on them is
                        even more reliable than using the "To" or "Cc" headers, and since these
                        headers are added to each post by the mailing list management software
                        itself, some users may be counting on their presence:</p><pre class="screen">list-help: &lt;mailto:discuss-help@lists.example.org&gt;

                                                                            href="http://www.nisto.com/listspec/list-manager-intro.html"
                                                                            target="_top">nisto.com/listspec/list-manager-intro.html</a>

                    </p>

                    <p>Having said all that, these days I find that most subscribers
                        just request that the Subject header include a list-identifying
                        prefix. That's increasingly how people are accustomed to filtering
                        email: Subject-based filtering is what many of the major online email
                        services (like Gmail) offer users by default, and those services tend
                        not to make it easy to see the presence of less-commonly used headers
                        like the ones I mentioned above&nbsp;â&nbsp;thus making it hard
                        for people to figure out that they would even have the option of
                        filtering on those other headers.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, reluctantly, I recommend using a Subject prefix (keep
                        it as short as you can) if that's what your community wants. But if
                        your project highly technical and most of its participants are
                        comfortable using the other headers, then that option is always there
                        as a more space-efficient alternative.</p>

                    <p>It also used to be the case that if you have a mailing list
                        named "foo", then you also have administrative addresses "foo-help"
                        and "foo-unsubscribe" available. In addition to these, it was
                        traditional to have "foo-subscribe" for joining, and "foo-owner",
                        for reaching the list administrators. Increasingly, however,
                        subscribers manage their list membership via Web-based interfaces, so
                        even if the list management software you use sets up these
                        administrative addresses, they may go largely unused.</p>

                    <p>Some mailing list software offers an option to append
                        unsubscription instructions to the bottom of every post. If that
                        option is available, turn it on. It causes only a couple of extra
                        lines per message, in a harmless location, and it can save you a lot
                        of time, by cutting down on the number of people who mail youâor
                        worse, mail the list!âasking how to unsubscribe.</p></div>

                    <p>Earlier, in <a class="xref" href="#avoid-private-discussions" title="Avoid Private Discussions">the
                        section called âAvoid Private Discussionsâ</a>, I stressed the
                        importance of making sure discussions stay in public forums, and
                        talked about how active measures are sometimes needed to prevent
                        conversations from trailing off into private email threads;
                        furthermore, this chapter is all about setting up project
                        communications software to do as much of the work for people as possible.
                        Therefore, if the mailing list management software offers a way to
                        automatically cause discussions to stay on the list, you would think
                        turning on that feature would be the obvious choice.</p>

                    <p>Well, not quite. There is such a feature, but it has some
                        pretty severe disadvantages. The question of whether or not to use it
                        is one of the hottest debates in mailing list
                        managementâadmittedly, not a controversy that's likely to make
                        the evening news in your city, but it can flare up from time to time
                        in free software projects. Below, I will describe the feature, give
                        the major arguments on both sides, and make the best recommendation I
                        can.</p>

                    <p>The feature itself is very simple: the mailing list software
                        can, if you wish, automatically set the Reply-to header on every post
                        to redirect replies to the mailing list. That is, no matter what the
                        original sender puts in the Reply-to header (or even if they don't
                        include one at all), by the time the list subscribers see the post,
                        the header will contain the list address:</p><pre class="screen">Reply-to: discuss@lists.example.org
</pre>
                    <p>On its face, this seems like a good thing. Because virtually
                        all mail reading software pays attention to the Reply-to header, now
                        when anyone responds to a post, their response will be automatically
                        addressed to the entire list, not just to the sender of the message
                        being responded to. Of course, the responder can still manually
                        change where the message goes, but the important thing is that
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>by default</em></span> replies are directed to the list.
                        It's a perfect example of using technology to encourage
                        collaboration.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages. The first is known
                        as the <em class="firstterm">Can't Find My Way Back Home</em> problem:
                        sometimes the original sender will put their "real" email address in
                        the Reply-to field, because for one reason or another they send email
                        from a different address than where they receive it. People who
                        always read and send from the same location don't have this problem,
                        and may be surprised that it even exists. But for those who have
                        unusual email configurations, or who cannot control how the From
                        address on their mails looks (perhaps because they send from work and
                        do not have any influence over the IT department), using Reply-to may
                        be the only way they have to ensure that responses reach them. When
                        such a person posts to a mailing list that he's not subscribed to, his
                        setting of Reply-to becomes essential information. If the list
                        software overwrites it<sup>[<a name="idp6252128" href="#ftn.idp6252128" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup>,
                        he may
                        never see the responses to his post.</p>

                    <p>The second disadvantage has to do with expectations, and in my
                        opinion is the most powerful argument against Reply-to munging. Most
                        experienced mail users are accustomed to two basic methods of
                        replying: <em class="firstterm">reply-to-all</em> and
                        <em class="firstterm">reply-to-author</em>. All modern mail reading
                        software has separate keys for these two actions. Users know that to
                        reply to everyone (that is, including the list), they should choose
                        reply-to-all, and to reply privately to the author, they should choose
                        reply-to-author. Although you want to encourage people to reply to
                        the list whenever possible, there are certainly circumstances where a
                        private reply is the responder's prerogativeâfor example, they
                        may want to say something confidential to the author of the original
                        message, something that would be inappropriate on the public
                        list.</p>

                    <p>Now consider what happens when the list has overridden the
                        original sender's Reply-to. The responder hits the reply-to-author
                        key, expecting to send a private message back to the original author.
                        Because that's the expected behavior, he may not bother to look
                        carefully at the recipient address in the new message. He composes
                        his private, confidential message, one which perhaps says embarrassing
                        things about someone on the list, and hits the send key.
                        Unexpectedly, a few minutes later his message appears <span class="emphasis"><em>on the
                            mailing list!</em></span> True, in theory he should have looked
                        carefully at the recipient field, and should not have assumed anything
                        about the Reply-to header. But authors almost always set Reply-to to
                        their own personal address (or rather, their mail software sets it for
                        them), and many longtime email users have come to expect that. In
                        fact, when a person deliberately sets Reply-to to some other address,
                        such as the list, she usually makes a point of mentioning this in the
                        body of her message, so people won't be surprised at what happens when
                        they reply.</p>

                    <p>Because of the possibly severe consequences of this unexpected
                        behavior, my own preference is to configure list management software
                        to never touch the Reply-to header. This is one instance where using
                        technology to encourage collaboration has, it seems to me, potentially
                        dangerous side-effects. However, there are also some powerful
                        arguments on the other side of this debate. Whichever way you choose,
                        you will occasionally get people posting to your list asking why you
                        didn't choose the other way. Since this is not something you ever
                        want as the main topic of discussion on your list, it might be good to
                        have a canned response ready, of the sort that's more likely to stop
                        discussion than encourage it. Make sure you do
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> insist that your decision, whichever it is,
                        is obviously the only right and sensible one (even if you think that's
                        the case). Instead, point out that this is a very old debate, there
                        are good arguments on both sides, no choice is going to satisfy
                        all users, and therefore you just made the best decision you
                        could. Politely ask that the subject not be revisited unless someone
                        has something genuinely new to say, then stay out of the thread and
                        hope it dies a natural death.</p>

                    <p>Someone may suggest a vote to choose one way or the other. You
                        can do that if you want, but I personally do not feel that counting
                        heads is a satisfactory solution in this case. The penalty for
                        someone who is surprised by the behavior is so huge (accidentally
                        sending a private mail to a public list), and the inconvenience for
                        everyone else is fairly slight (occasionally having to remind someone
                        to respond to the whole list instead of just to you), that it's not
                        clear that the majority, even though they are the majority, should be
                        able to put the minority at such risk.</p>

                    <p>I have not addressed all aspects of this issue here, just the
                        ones that seemed of overriding importance. For a full discussion, see
                        these two canonical documents, which are the ones people always cite
                        when they're having this debate:

                        lists that <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> set Reply-to. The most important
                        thing you can do is settle on one way or the other early, and try not
                        to get entangled in debates about it after that. When the debate
                        re-arises every few years, as it inevitably will, you can point people
                        to the archived discussion from last time.</p>

                        <p>Someday, someone will get the bright idea to implement a
                            <em class="firstterm">reply-to-list</em> key in a mail reader. It would
                            use some of the custom list headers mentioned earlier to figure out
                            the address of the mailing list, and then address the reply directly
                            to the list only, leaving off any other recipient addresses, since
                            most are probably subscribed to the list anyway. Eventually, other
                            mail readers will pick up the feature, and this whole debate will go
                            away. (Actually, the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mutt.org/" target="_top">Mutt</a>
                            mail reader does offer this feature.<sup>[<a name="idp6270128" href="#ftn.idp6270128"

                        <p>An even better solution would be for Reply-to munging to be a
                            per-subscriber preference. Those who want the list to set Reply-to
                            munged (either on others' posts or on their own posts) could ask for
                            that, and those who don't would ask for Reply-to to be left alone.
                            However, I don't know of any list management software that offers this
                            on a per-subscriber basis. For now, we seem to be stuck with a global
                            setting.<sup>[<a name="idp6272288" href="#ftn.idp6272288" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup></p>

                                should archive each post instantaneously, so that by the

                                every hour or so. (By default, some archivers run their
                                update processes once per night, but in practice that's
                                far too much lag time for an active mailing list.)</p></dd>

                                <p>Ideally, mailing list software would include a message's
                                    archive URL, or at least the message-specific portion of
                                    the URL, in a header when it distributes the message to
                                    recipients. That way people who have a copy of the
                                    message would be able to know its archive location
                                    without having to actually visit the archives, which would
                                    be helpful because any operation that involves one's web
                                    browser is automatically time-consuming. Whether any
                                    mailing list software actually offers this feature, I don't
                                    know; unfortunately, the ones I have used do not.
                                    However, it's something to look for (or, if you write
                                    mailing list software, it's a feature to consider
                                    implementing, please).</p></dd>

                                fine-tuned, because it allows the searcher to specify that
                                the match must appear in a subject line versus the body,
                                for example.</p></dd>

                    <p>Here are some tools for running message forums. If the site
                        where you're hosting your project already has a default setup, then
                        you can just use that and avoid having to choose. But if you need to
                        install one yourself, below are some possibilities. (Of course, there
                        are probably other tools out there that I just didn't happen to find,
                        so don't take this as a complete list).</p>

                                <p>Listing Google Groups first was a tough call. The service is
                                    not itself open source, and a few of its administrative
                                    functions can be a bit hard to use. However, its advantages
                                    are substantial: your group's archives are always online and
                                    searchable; you don't have to worry about scalability,
                                    backups, or other run-time infrastructure issues; the
                                    moderation and spam-prevention features are pretty good (with
                                    the latter constantly being improved, which is important in
                                    the neverending spam arms race); and Google Groups are easily
                                    accessible via both email and web, in ways that are likely to
                                    be already familiar to many participants. These are strong
                                    advantages. If you just want to get your project started,
                                    and don't want to spend too much time thinking about what
                                    message forum software or service to use, Google Groups
                                    is a good default choice.</p></li>

                                <p>For many years, Mailman was the standard for open source
                                    project mailing lists. It comes with a built-in archiver,
                                    Pipermail, and hooks for plugging in external archivers.
                                    Unfortunately, Mailman is showing its age now, and while
                                    it is very reliable in terms of message delivery and other
                                    under-the-hood functionality, its administrative
                                    interfaces&nbsp;â&nbsp;especially for spam moderation
                                    and subscription moderation&nbsp;â&nbsp;are frustrating
                                    for those accustomed to the modern Web. As of this writing
                                    in late 2013, the long-awaited Mailman 3 was still in
                                    development but was about to enter beta-testing; by the time
                                    you read this, Mailman 3 may be released, and would be worth
                                    a look. It is supposed to solve many of the problems of
                                    Mailman 2, and may make Mailman a reasonable choice again.</p></li>

            <p>A <em class="firstterm">version control system</em> (or
                <em class="firstterm">revision control system</em>) is a combination of
                technologies and practices for tracking and controlling changes to a
                project's files, in particular to source code, documentation, and web
                pages. If you have never used version control before, the first thing
                you should do is go find someone who has, and get them to join your
                project. These days, everyone will expect at least your project's
                source code to be under version control, and probably will not take
                the project seriously if it doesn't use version control with at least
                minimal competence.</p>

            <p>The reason version control is so universal is that it helps with
                virtually every aspect of running a project: inter-developer
                communications, release management, bug management, code stability and
                experimental development efforts, and attribution and authorization of
                changes by particular developers. The version control system provides
                a central coordinating force among all of these areas. The core of
                version control is <em class="firstterm">change management</em>:
                identifying each discrete change made to the project's files,
                annotating each change with metadata like the change's date and
                author, and then replaying these facts to whoever asks, in whatever
                way they ask. It is a communications mechanism where a change is the
                basic unit of information.</p>

            <p>This section does not discuss all aspects of using a version
                control system. It's so all-encompassing that it must be addressed
                topically throughout the book. Here, we will concentrate on choosing
                and setting up a version control system in a way that will foster
                cooperative development down the road.</p>

                <p>This book cannot teach you how to use version control if you've
                    never used it before, but it would be impossible to discuss the
                    subject without a few key terms. These terms are useful independently
                    of any particular version control system: they are the basic nouns and
                    verbs of networked collaboration, and will be used generically
                    throughout the rest of this book. Even if there were no version
                    control systems in the world, the problem of change management would
                    remain, and these words give us a language for talking about that
                    problem concisely.</p>

                <p>If you're comfortably experienced with version control already,
                    you can probably skip this section. If you're not sure, then read
                    through this section at least once. Certain version control terms
                    have gradually changed in meaning since the early 2000s, and you may
                    occasionally find people using them in incompatible ways in the same
                    conversation. Being able to detect that phenomenon early in a
                    discussion can often be helpful.</p>

                            edition number, as in "Version 1.0". However, since the phrase
                            "version control" is already standard, I will continue to use it as
                            a synonym for "revision control" and "change control". Sorry. One
                            of open source's most endearing characteristics is that it has two
                            words for everything, and one word for every two things.</p></div>

                                main trunk. Or conversely, a branch can be used as a place to
                                stabilize a new release. During the release process, regular
                                development would continue uninterrupted in the main branch of the
                                repository; meanwhile, on the release branch, no changes are allowed
                                except those approved by the release managers. This way, making a

                            versa. In fact, those are the most common kinds of merges; it is
                            less common to port a change between two non-trunk branches. See

                            <p>"Merge" has a second, related meaning: it is what some version
                                control systems do when they see that two people have changed the
                                same file but in non-overlapping ways. Since the two changes do not
                                interfere with each other, when one of the people updates their copy
                                of the file (already containing their own changes), the other
                                person's changes will be automatically merged in. This is very
                                common, especially on projects where multiple people are hacking on
                                the same code. When two different changes <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span>
                                overlap, the result is a "conflict"; see below.</p></dd>

                            parallel, simultaneous development is the norm, and locking people

                <p>If you don't already have a strong opinion about which version
                    control system your project should use, then choose Git (<a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com/"
                                                                                target="_top">git-scm.com</a>), and host
                    your
                    project's repositories at <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/" target="_top">GitHub.com</a>,
                    which offers unlimited free hosting for open
                    source projects.</p>

                <p>Git is by now the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span>
                    standard in the open source world, as is hosting one's repositories at
                    GitHub. Because so many developers are already comfortable with that
                    combination, choosing it sends the signal that your project is ready
                    for participants. But Git-at-GitHub is not the only viable
                    combination. Two other reasonable choices of version control system
                    are <a class="ulink" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_top">Mercurial</a> and
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>.
                    Mercurial and Git are both decentralized systems, whereas Subversion
                    is centralized. All three are offered at many different free hosting
                    services; some services even support more than one of them (though
                    GitHub only supports Git, as its name suggests). While some projects
                    host their repositories on their own servers, most just put their
                    repositories on one of the free hosting services, as described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">the section called âCanned
                        Hostingâ</a>.</p>

                <p>There isn't space here for an in-depth exploration of why you
                    might choose something other than Git. If you have a reason to do so,
                    then you already know what that reason is. If you don't, then just
                    use Git (and probably on GitHub). If you find yourself using
                    something other than Git, Mercurial, or Subversion, ask yourself
                    why&nbsp;â&nbsp;because whatever that other version control
                    system is, most other developers won't be familiar with it, and it
                    likely has a smaller and less stable community of support around it
                    than the big three do.</p></div>

                <p>The recommendations in this section are not targeted toward a
                    particular version control system, and should be implementable in any
                    of them. Consult your specific system's documentation for
                    details.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Version everything">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="version-everything"></a>Version everything</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Keep not only your project's source code under version control,
                        but also its web pages, documentation, FAQ, design notes, and anything
                        else that people might want to edit. Keep them right with the
                        source code, in the same repository tree. Any piece of information
                        worth writing down is worth versioningâthat is, any piece of
                        information that could change. Things that don't change should be
                        archived, not versioned. For example, an email, once posted, does not
                        change; therefore, versioning it wouldn't make sense (unless it becomes
                        part of some larger, evolving document).</p>

                    <p>The reason to version everything together in one place is so
                        that people only have to learn one mechanism for submitting changes.
                        Often a contributor will start out making edits to the web pages or
                        documentation, and move to small code contributions later, for
                        example. When the project uses the same system for all kinds of
                        submissions, people only have to learn the ropes once. Versioning
                        everything together also means that new features can be committed
                        together with their documentation updates, that branching the code
                        will branch the documentation too, etc.</p>

                    <p>Don't keep <em class="firstterm">generated files</em> under version
                        control. They are not truly editable data, since they are produced
                        programmatically from other files. For example, some build systems
                        create a file named <code class="filename">configure</code> based on a template
                        in <code class="filename">configure.in</code>. To make a change to the
                        <code class="filename">configure</code>, one would edit
                        <code class="filename">configure.in</code> and then regenerate; thus, only the
                        template <code class="filename">configure.in</code> is an "editable file."
                        Just version the templatesâif you version the generated files as
                        well, people will inevitably forget to regenerate them when they commit a
                        change to a template, and the resulting inconsistencies will cause no
                        end of confusion.</p>

                    <p>There are technical exceptions to the rule that all editable
                        data should be kept in the same version control system as the code.
                        For example, a project's bug tracker and its wiki hold plenty of
                        editable data, but usually do not store that data in the main version
                        control system<sup>[<a name="idp6391936" href="#ftn.idp6391936" class="footnote">32</a>]</sup>.
                        However,
                        they should still have versioning systems of their own, e.g., the
                        comment history in a bug ticket, and the ability to browse past
                        revisions and view differences between them in a wiki.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Browsability">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="vc-browsing"></a>Browsability</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>The project's repository should be browsable on the Web. This
                        means not only the ability to see the latest revisions of the
                        project's files, but to go back in time and look at earlier revisions,
                        view the differences between revisions, read log messages for selected
                        changes, etc.</p>

                    <p>Browsability is important because it is a lightweight portal to
                        project data. If the repository cannot be viewed through a web
                        browser, then someone wanting to inspect a particular file (say, to
                        see if a certain bugfix had made it into the code) would first have to
                        install version control client software locally, which could turn
                        their simple query from a two-minute task into a half-hour or longer
                        task.</p>

                    <p>Browsability also implies canonical URLs for viewing a
                        particular change (i.e., a commit), and for viewing the latest
                        revision at any given time without specifying its commit identifier.
                        This can be very useful in technical discussions or when pointing
                        people to documentation or examples. If you tell someone a URL that
                        always points to the latest revision of the a file, or to a particular
                        known version, the communication is completely unambiguous, while
                        avoiding the issue of whether the recipient has an up-to-date working
                        copy of the code themselves.</p>

                    <p>Some version control systems come with built-in
                        repository-browsing mechanisms, and in any case all hosting sites
                        offer it via their web interfaces. But if you need to install a
                        third-party tool to get repository browsing, do so; it's worth
                        it.</p></div>

                    <p>Non-expert version control users are sometimes a bit afraid of
                        branching and merging. If you are among those people, resolve right
                        now to conquer any fears you may have and take the time to learn how
                        to do branching and merging. They are not difficult operations, once
                        you get used to them, and they become increasingly important as a
                        project acquires more developers.</p>

                    <p>Branches are valuable because they turn a scarce
                        resourceâworking room in the project's codeâinto an
                        abundant one. Normally, all developers work together in the same
                        sandbox, constructing the same castle. When someone wants to add a
                        new drawbridge, but can't convince everyone else that it would be an
                        improvement, branching makes it possible for her to copy the
                        castle, take it off to an isolated corner, and try out the new
                        drawbridge design. If the effort succeeds, she can invite the
                        other developers to examine the result (in GitHub-speak, this
                        invitation is known as a "pull request"&nbsp;â&nbsp;see <a class="xref" href="#pull-requests"
                                                                                   title="Pull requests">the section
                            called âPull requestsâ</a>). If everyone agrees that the
                        result is good, she or someone else can tell the version control
                        system to move ("merge") the drawbridge from the branch version of the
                        castle over to the main version, sometimes called the
                        <em class="firstterm">master branch</em>.</p>

                    <p>It's easy to see how this ability helps collaborative
                        development. People need the freedom to try new things without
                        feeling like they're interfering with others' work. Equally
                        importantly, there are times when code needs to be isolated from the
                        usual development churn, in order to get a bug fixed or a release
                        stabilized (see <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">the

                        about tracking a moving target. At the same time, people need to be
                        able to review and comment on experimental work, whether it's
                        happening in the master branch or somewhere else. Treating branches
                        as first-class, publishable objects makes all this possible.</p>

                    <p>Use branches liberally, and encourage others to use them. But
                        also make sure that a given branch is only active for as long as
                        needed. Every active branch is a slight drain on the community's
                        attention. Even those who are not working in a branch still stumble
                        across it occasionally; it enters their peripheral awareness from time
                        to time and draws some attention. Sometimes such awareness is
                        desirable, of course, and commit notices should be sent out for branch
                        commits just as for any other commit. But branches should not become
                        a mechanism for dividing the development community's efforts. With
                        rare exceptions, the eventual goal of most branches should be to merge
                        their changes back into the main line and disappear, as soon as
                        possible.</p></div>

                    <p>Merging has an important corollary: never commit the same change
                        twice. That is, a given change should enter the version control
                        system exactly once. The revision (or set of revisions) in which the
                        change entered is its unique identifier from then on. If it needs to
                        be applied to branches other than the one on which it entered, then it
                        should be merged from its original entry point to those other
                        destinationsâas opposed to committing a textually identical
                        change, which would have the same effect in the code, but would make
                        accurate bookkeeping and release management much harder.</p>

                    <p>The practical effects of this advice differ from one version
                        control system to another. In some systems, merges are special
                        events, fundamentally distinct from commits, and carry their own
                        metadata with them. In others, the results of merges are committed
                        the same way other changes are committed, so the primary means of
                        distinguishing a "merge commit" from a "new change commit" is in the
                        log message. In a merge's log message, don't repeat the log message
                        of the original change. Instead, just indicate that this is a merge,
                        and give the identifying revision of the original change, with at most
                        a one-sentence summary of its effect. If someone wants to see the
                        full log message, she should consult the original revision.
                        Non-duplication makes it easier to be sure when one has tracked down
                        the original source of a change: when you're looking at a complete log
                        message that doesn't refer to a some other merge source, you can know
                        that it must be the original change, and treat it accordingly.</p>

                    <p>The same principle applies to reverting a change. If a change
                        is withdrawn from the code, then the log message for the reversion
                        should merely state that some specific revision(s) is being reverted,
                        and explain why. It should not describe the semantic code change that
                        results from the reversion, since that can be derived by consulting
                        the original log message and change. (And if you're using a system in
                        which editing past log messages is possible, such as Subversion, go
                        back and edit the original change's log message to mention the future
                        reversion.</p>

                    <p>All of the above implies that you should use a consistent syntax
                        for referring to changes. This is helpful not only in log messages,
                        but in emails, the bug tracker, and elsewhere. In Git and Mercurial,
                        the syntax is usually "commit bb2377" (where the commit hash code on
                        the right is long enough to be unique in the relevant context); in
                        Subversion, revision numbers are linearly incremented integers and the
                        standard syntax for, say, revision 1729 is "r1729". In other systems,
                        there is usually a standard syntax for expressing the changeset name.
                        Whatever the appropriate syntax is for your system, encourage people
                        to use it when referring to changes. Consistent expression of change
                        names makes project bookkeeping much easier (as we will see in <a class="xref"
                                                                                          href="#communications"

                        and since a lot of the bookkeeping may be done by volunteers, it
                        needs to be as easy as possible.</p>

                    <p>Many version control systems offer a feature whereby certain
                        people can be allowed or disallowed from committing in specific
                        sub-areas of the master repository. Following the principle that when
                        handed a hammer, people start looking around for nails, many projects use
                        this feature with abandon, carefully granting people access to just
                        those areas where they have been approved to commit, and making sure
                        they can't commit anywhere else. (See
                        <a class="xref" href="#committers" title="Committers">the section called âCommittersâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span> for how projects
                        decide who can put changes where.)</p>

                    <p>Exercising such tight control is usually unnecessary, and may
                        even be harmful. Some projects simply use an honor system: when a
                        person is granted commit access, even for a sub-area of the project,
                        what they actually receive is the ability to commit anywhere in the
                        master repository. They're just asked to keep their commits in their
                        area. Remember that there is little real risk here: the repository
                        provides an audit trail, and in an active project, all commits are
                        reviewed anyway. If someone commits where they're not supposed to,
                        others will notice it and say something. If a change needs to be
                        undone, that's simple enoughâeverything's under version control
                        anyway, so just revert.</p>

                    <p>There are several advantages to this more relaxed approach.
                        First, as developers expand into other areas (which they usually will
                        if they stay with the project), there is no administrative overhead to
                        granting them wider privileges. Once the decision is made, the person
                        can just start committing in the new area right away.</p>

                    <p>Second, expansion can be done in a more fine-grained manner.
                        Generally, a committer in area X who wants to expand to area Y will
                        start posting patches against Y and asking for review. If someone who
                        already has commit access to area Y sees such a patch and approves of
                        it, she can just tell the submitter to commit the change directly
                        (mentioning the reviewer/approver's name in the log message, of
                        course). That way, the commit will come from the person who actually
                        wrote the change, which is preferable from both an information
                        management standpoint and from a crediting standpoint.</p>

                    <p>Last, and perhaps most important, using the honor system
                        encourages an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect. Giving someone
                        commit access to a subdomain is a statement about their technical
                        preparednessâit says: "We see you have expertise to make commits
                        in a certain domain, so go for it." But imposing strict authorization
                        controls says: "Not only are we asserting a limit on your expertise,
                        we're also a bit suspicious about
                        your <span class="emphasis"><em>intentions</em></span>." That's not the sort of
                        statement you want to make if you can avoid it. Bringing someone into
                        the project as a committer is an opportunity to initiate them into a
                        circle of mutual trust. A good way to do that is to give them more
                        power than they're supposed to use, then inform them that it's up to
                        them to stay within the stated limits.</p>

                    <p>The Subversion project has operated on this honor system way or
                        well over a decade, with more than 40 full committers and many more
                        partial committers as of this writing. The only distinction the
                        system actually enforces is
                        between committers and non-committers; further subdivisions are
                        maintained solely by human judgement. Yet the project never had a
                        serious problem with someone deliberately committing outside their
                        domain. Once or twice there's been an innocent misunderstanding about
                        the extent of someone's commit privileges, but it's always been
                        resolved quickly and amiably.</p>

                    <p>Obviously, in situations where self-policing is impractical, you
                        must rely on hard authorization controls. But such situations are
                        rare. Even when there are millions of lines of code and hundreds or
                        thousands of developers, a commit to any given code module should
                        still be reviewed by those who work on that module, and they can
                        recognize if someone committed there who wasn't supposed to. If
                        regular commit review <span class="emphasis"><em>isn't</em></span> happening, then the
                        project has bigger problems to deal with than the authorization system
                        anyway.</p>

                    <p>In summary, don't spend too much time fiddling with the version
                        control authorization system, unless you have a specific reason to. It
                        usually won't bring much tangible benefit, and there are advantages to
                        relying on human controls instead.</p>

                    <p>None of this should be taken to mean that the restrictions
                        themselves are unimportant, of course. It would be bad for a project
                        to encourage people to commit in areas where they're not qualified.
                        Furthermore, in many projects, full (unrestricted) commit access has a
                        special corollary status: it implies voting rights on project-wide
                        questions. This political aspect of commit access is discussed more

                <p>These days the primary means by which
                    changes&nbsp;â&nbsp;code contributions, documentation
                    contributions, etc&nbsp;â&nbsp;reach a project is via "pull
                    requests" (described in more detail below), though some older projects
                    still prefer to receive a patch posted to a mailing list or attached
                    in a bug tracker. Once a contribution arrives, it typically goes
                    through a review-and-revise process, involving communication between
                    the contributor and various members of the project. At some point
                    during the process, if all goes well, the contribution is eventually
                    deemed ready for incorporation into the main code base and is merged
                    in. This does not mean that discussion and work on the contribution
                    cease at that point. The contribution may well continue to be
                    improved, it's just that that improvement now takes place within the
                    project rather than off to one side. The moment when a code change is
                    merged to the project's master branch is when it becomes officially
                    part of the project. It is no longer the sole responsibility of
                    whoever submitted it; it is the collective responsibility of the
                    project as a whole.</p>

                        targeted at some other branch).</p>

                    <p>The change is offered in the form of the difference between the
                        contributor's copy (or "clone") of the project and the project's own
                        copy. The two copies share most of their change history, of course,
                        but at a certain point the contributor's diverges&nbsp;â&nbsp;it
                        contains the change the contributor has implemented and that the
                        project does not have yet. The project may also have moved on since
                        the clone was made and contain new changes that the contributor does
                        not have, but these can be ignored for the purposes of discussion
                        here. A pull request is directional: it is for sending changes the
                        contributor has that the receiver does not, and is not about changes
                        flowing in the reverse direction.</p>

                    <p>In practice, the two copies are usually stored on the same
                        hosting site, and the contributor can initiate the pull request by
                        simply clicking a button. On GitHub, and perhaps on other hosting
                        sites, creating a pull request automatically creates a corresponding
                        ticket in the project's bug tracker, so that a pending pull request
                        can be conveniently tracked using the same workflow as any other
                        issue. Some projects have also contributions enter through a
                        collaborative code review tool, such as <a class="ulink"
                                                                   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_%28software%29"

                            Board</a>, although GitHub has started building some of the
                        features of code-review tools into its pull request management
                        interface.</p>

                    <p>Pull requests are so frequent a topic of discussion that you
                        will often see people abbreviate them as "PR", as in "Yeah, your
                        proposed fix sounds good. Would you send me a PR please?" For
                        newcomers, however, the term "pull request" is sometimes confusing,
                        however, because it sounds like it is request by the contributor to
                        pull a change from someone else, when actually it is a request the
                        contributor makes to to someone else (the project) to pull the change
                        from the contributor. Some systems use the term <em class="firstterm">merge
                            request</em> to mean the same thing. I actually find that term
                        much more natural, but alas, "pull request" appears to have won, and
                        we all need to just get used to it. I'm not bitter.</p></div>

                    <p>Every commit to the repository&nbsp;â&nbsp;or every push
                        containing a group of commits&nbsp;â&nbsp;should generate a
                        notification that goes out to a subscribable forum, such as an email
                        sent to a mailing list. The notification should show who made the
                        change, when they made it, what files and directories changed, and the
                        actual content of the change.</p>

                    <p>The most common form of commit notifications is just to have a
                        mailing list that developers or any interested party can subscribe to,
                        and send an email to that list for each commit or push. This is a
                        special mailing list devoted to commit emails, separate from the
                        mailing lists to which humans post. Developers should be encouraged
                        to subscribe to the commits list, as it is the most effective way to
                        keep up with what's happening in the project at the code level. Aside
                        from the obvious technical benefits of peer review (see <a class="xref" href="#code-review"
                                                                                   title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the
                            section called âPractice Conspicuous Code Reviewâ</a>), commit emails help create a sense of
                        community, because they establish a shared environment in which people
                        can react to events that they know are visible to others as
                        well.</p>

                    <p>Whether your project should use an email list or some other kind
                        of subscribable notification forum depends on the demographics of your
                        developers, but when in doubt, email is usually a good default choice.
                        The specifics of setting up notifications will vary depending on your
                        version control system, but usually there's a script or other packaged
                        facility for doing it. If you're having trouble finding it, try
                        looking for documentation on <em class="firstterm">hooks</em> (or
                        sometimes <em class="firstterm">triggers</em>) specifically a
                        <em class="firstterm">post-merge hook</em> or <em class="firstterm">post-commit
                            hook</em> hook. These hooks are a general means of launching
                        automated tasks in response to receiving changes. The hook is fed all
                        the information about the merge, and is then free to use that
                        information to do anythingâfor example, to send out an
                        email.</p>

                    <p>With pre-packaged commit email systems, you may want to
                        modify some of the default behaviors:</p>

                    <div class="orderedlist">
                        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                            <li class="listitem"><p>Some commit mailers don't include the actual diffs in the
                                email, but instead provide a URL to view the change on the web using
                                the repository browsing system. While it's good to provide the URL,
                                so the change can be referred to later, it is also important that
                                the commit email include
                                the diffs themselves. Reading email is already part of people's
                                routine, so if the content of the change is visible right there in
                                the commit email, developers will review the commit on the spot,
                                without leaving their mail reader. If they have to click on a URL to
                                review the change, most won't do it, because that requires a new
                                action instead of a continuation of what they were already doing.
                                Furthermore, if the reviewer wants to ask something about the
                                change, it's vastly easier to hit reply-with-text and simply
                                annotate the quoted diff than it is to visit a web page and
                                laboriously cut-and-paste parts of the diff from web browser to
                                email client.</p>

                                <p>(Of course, if the diff is huge, such as when a large body of
                                    new code has been added to the repository, then it makes sense to
                                    omit the diff and offer only the URL. Most commit mailers can do
                                    this kind of size-limiting automatically. If yours can't, then it's
                                    still better to include diffs, and live with the occasional huge
                                    email, than to leave the diffs off entirely. Convenient reviewing
                                    and commenting is a cornerstone of cooperative development, and much
                                    too important to do without.)</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>The commit emails should set their Reply-to header
                                to the regular development list, not the commit email list. That
                                is, when someone reviews a commit and writes a response, their
                                response should be automatically directed toward the human
                                development list, where technical issues are normally discussed.
                                There are a few reasons for this. First, you want to keep all
                                technical discussion on one list, because that's where people expect
                                it to happen, and because that way there's only one archive to
                                search. Second, there might be interested parties not subscribed to
                                the commit email list. Third, the commit email list advertises
                                itself as a service for watching commits, not for watching commits
                                <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> having occasional technical discussions.
                                Those who subscribed to the commit email list did not sign up for
                                anything but commit emails; sending them other material via that
                                list would violate an implicit contract.</p>

                                <p>Note that this advice to set Reply-to does not contradict the
                                    recommendations in

                                    always okay for the <span class="emphasis"><em>sender</em></span> of a message to

                                    itself, and it sets Reply-to in order to indicate that the
                                    appropriate place for replies is the development mailing list, not
                                    the commit list.</p></li>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Bug tracking is a broad topic; various aspects of it are
                discussed throughout this book. Here I'll concentrate mainly on the
                features your project should look for in a bug tracker, and how to use
                them. But to get to those, we have to start with a policy question:
                exactly what kind of information should be kept in a bug
                tracker?</p>

            <p>The term <em class="firstterm">bug tracker</em> is misleading. Bug
                tracking systems are used to track not only bug reports, but new
                feature requests, one-time tasks, unsolicited patchesâreally
                anything that has distinct beginning and end states, with optional
                transition states in between, and that accrues information over its
                lifetime. For this reason, bug trackers are also called
                <em class="firstterm">issue trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">ticket
                    trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">defect trackers</em>,
                <em class="firstterm">artifact trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">request
                    trackers</em>, etc.</p>

            <p>In this book, I'll generally use the word
                <em class="firstterm">ticket</em> to refer the items in the tracker's
                database, because that distinguishes between the behavior that the
                user encountered or proposed&nbsp;â&nbsp;that is, the bug or
                feature itself&nbsp;â&nbsp;and the tracker's ongoing
                <span class="emphasis"><em>record</em></span> of that discovery, diagnosis, discussion,
                and eventual resolution. But note that many projects use the word
                <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>issue</em></span> to refer to
                both the ticket itself and to the underlying behavior or goal that the
                ticket is tracking. (In fact, those usages are probably more common than
                "ticket"; it's just that in this book we need to be able to make that
                distinction explicitly in a way that projects themselves usually
                don't.)</p>

            <p>The classic ticket life cycle looks like this:

            </p>

            <div class="orderedlist">
                <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Someone files the ticket. They provide a summary, an
                        initial description (including a reproduction recipe, if
                        applicable; see
                        <a class="xref" href="#users-to-volunteers" title="Treat Every User as a Potential Volunteer">the
                            section called âTreat Every User as a Potential Volunteerâ</a><span> in
            <a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8,
                <i>Managing Volunteers</i></a></span> for
                        how to encourage good bug reports), and whatever other
                        information the tracker asks for. The person who files
                        the ticket may be totally unknown to the projectâbug
                        reports and feature requests are as likely to come from
                        the user community as from the developers.</p>

                        <p>Once filed, the ticket is in what's called an
                            <em class="firstterm">open</em> state. Because no action has
                            been taken yet, some trackers also label it as
                            <em class="firstterm">unverified</em> and/or
                            <em class="firstterm">unstarted</em>. It is not assigned to
                            anyone; or, in some systems, it is assigned to a fake
                            user to represent the lack of real assignation. At this
                            point, it is in a holding area: the ticket has been
                            recorded, but not yet integrated into the project's
                            consciousness.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Others read the ticket, add comments to it, and
                        perhaps ask the original filer for clarification on some
                        points.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets <em class="firstterm">reproduced</em>.
                        This may be the most important moment in its
                        life cycle. Although the bug is not actually fixed yet,
                        the fact that someone besides the original filer was able
                        to make it happen proves that it is genuine, and, no less
                        importantly, confirms to the original filer that they've
                        contributed to the project by reporting a real bug.
            <span class="emphasis"><em>(This step and some of the others don't apply to
                feature proposals, task tickets, etc, of course. But most
                filings are for genuine bugs, so we'll focus on that
                here.)</em></span></p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets <em class="firstterm">diagnosed</em>: its

                        recorded in the ticket; if the person who diagnosed the
                        bug suddenly has to step away from it for a
                        while, someone else should be able to pick up where she
                        left off.</p>

                        <p>In this stage, or sometimes in the previous one,
                            a developer may "take ownership" of the ticket and
                            <em class="firstterm">assign</em> it to herself (<a class="xref"

                            early, and the tracker should have some way of noting
                            it.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The ticket gets scheduled for resolution.
                        Scheduling doesn't necessarily mean naming a date by which
                        it will be fixed. Sometimes it just means deciding which
                        future release (not necessarily the next one) the bug
                        should be fixed by, or deciding that it need not block any
                        particular release. Scheduling may also be dispensed
                        with, if the bug is quick to fix.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets fixed (or the task completed, or
                        the patch applied, or whatever). The change or set of
                        changes that fixed it should be discoverable from
                        the ticket. After this, the ticket is
                        <em class="firstterm">closed</em> and/or marked as

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>There are some common variations on this life cycle. Sometimes
                a ticket is closed very soon after being filed, because it turns out
                not to be a bug at all, but rather a misunderstanding on the part of
                the user. As a project acquires more users, more and more such
                invalid tickets will come in, and developers will close them with
                increasingly short-tempered responses. Try to guard against the
                latter tendency. It does no one any good, as the individual user in
                each case is not responsible for all the previous invalid tickets; the
                statistical trend is visible only from the developers' point of view,
                not the user's. (In
                <a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">the section called
                    âPre-Filtering the Bug Trackerâ</a><span> later
in this chapter,</span> we'll look at
                techniques for reducing the number of invalid tickets.) Also, if
                different users are experiencing the same misunderstanding over and
                over, it might mean that aspect of the software needs to be
                redesigned. This sort of pattern is easiest to notice when there is
                an issue manager monitoring the bug database; see
                <a class="xref" href="#issue-manager" title="Issue Manager">the section called âIssue Managerâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>.</p>

            <p>Another common life event for the ticket to be closed
                as a <em class="firstterm">duplicate</em> soon after Step 1. A duplicate
                is when someone reports something that's already known to the project.
                Duplicates are not confined to open tickets: it's possible for a bug to
                come back after having been fixed (this is known as a
                <em class="firstterm">regression</em>), in which case a reasonable course
                is to reopen the original ticket and close any new reports as
                duplicates of the original one. The bug tracking system should keep
                track of this relationship bidirectionally, so that reproduction
                information in the duplicates is available to the original ticket, and
                vice versa.</p>

            <p>A third variation is for the developers to close the ticket,
                thinking they have fixed it, only to have the original reporter reject
                the fix and reopen it. This is usually because the developers simply
                don't have access to the environment necessary to reproduce the bug,
                or because they didn't test the fix using the exact same reproduction
                recipe as the reporter.</p>

            <p>Aside from these variations, there may be other small details of
                the life cycle that vary depending on the tracking software. But the
                basic shape is the same, and while the life cycle itself is not
                specific to open source software, it has implications for how open
                source projects use their bug trackers.</p>

            <p>The tracker is as much a public face of the project as the
                mailing lists or web pages. Anyone may file a ticket, anyone may look
                at a ticket, and anyone may browse the list of currently open tickets.
                It follows that you never know how many people are waiting to see
                progress on a given ticket. While the size and skill of the
                development community constrains the rate at which tickets can be
                resolved, the project should at least try to acknowledge each ticket
                the moment it appears. Even if the ticket lingers for a while, a
                response encourages the reporter to stay involved, because she feels
                that a human has registered what she has done (remember that filing a
                ticket usually involves more effort than, say, posting an email).
                Furthermore, once a ticket is seen by a developer, it enters the
                project's consciousness, in the sense that the developer can be on the
                lookout for other instances of the ticket, can talk about it with
                other developers, etc.</p>

            <p>This centrality to the life of the project implies a few things
                about trackers' technical features:

                    <li class="listitem"><p>The tracker should be connected to email, such that
                        every change to a ticket, including its initial filing, causes a
                        notification mail to go out to some set of appropriate
                        recipients. See <a class="xref" href="#bug-tracker-email-interaction"

                        identity, as some people prefer to report anonymously. See <a class="xref" href="#anonymity"
                                                                                      title="Anonymity and involvement">the

    chapter</span> for more on the importance of anonymity.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>The tracker should have APIs. I cannot stress the
                        importance of this enough. If there is no way to interact with
                        the tracker programmatically, then in the long run there is no way
                        to interact with it scalably. APIs provide a route to customizing
                        the behavior of the tracker by, in effect, expanding it to include
                        third-party software. Instead of being just the specific ticket
                        tracking software running on a server somewhere, it's that
                        software <span class="emphasis"><em>plus</em></span> whatever custom behaviors your
                        project implements elsewhere and plugs in to the tracker via the
                        APIs.</p>

                        <p>Also, if your project uses a proprietary ticket tracker,
                            as is becoming more common now that so many projects host their
                            code on proprietary-but-free-of-charge hosting sites and just use
                            the site's built-in tracker, APIs provide a way to avoid being
                            locked in to that hosting platform. You can, in theory, take the
                            ticket history with you if you choose to go somewhere else (you
                            may never exercise this option, but think of it as
                            insurance&nbsp;â&nbsp;and some projects have actually done
                            it).</p>

                        <p>Currently, the ticket trackers of the big three hosting
                            sites (GitHub, Google Code Hosting, and SourceForge) all have
                            APIs, fortunately. Of them, only SourceForge is itself open
                            source, running a platform called

                <p>Most trackers now have at least decent email integration
                    features: at a minimum, the ability to create new tickets by email,
                    the ability to "subscribe" to a ticket to receive
                    emails about activity on that ticket, and the ability to add new
                    comments to a ticket by email. Some trackers even allow one to
                    manipulate ticket state (e.g., change the status field, the assignee,
                    etc) by email, and for people who use the tracker a lot, such as an
                    <a class="xref" href="#issue-manager" title="Issue Manager">the section called âIssue Managerâ</a>,
                    that can make a
                    huge difference in their ability to stay on top of tracker activity
                    and keep things organized.</p>

                <p>The tracker email feature that is likely to be used by everyone,
                    though, is simply the ability to read a ticket's activity by email and
                    respond by email. This is a valuable time-saver for many people in
                    the project, since it makes it easy to integrate bug traffic into
                    one's daily email flow. But don't let this integration give
                    anyone the illusion that the total collection of bug tickets and their
                    email traffic is the equivalent of the development mailing list. It's
                    not, and <a class="xref" href="#choose-the-forum" title="Choose the Right Forum">the section called

                <p>Most ticket databases eventually suffer from the same problem: a
                    crushing load of duplicate or invalid tickets filed by well-meaning but
                    inexperienced or ill-informed users. The first step in combatting
                    this trend is usually to put a prominent notice on the front page of
                    the bug tracker, explaining how to tell if a bug is really a bug, how
                    to search to see if it's already been reported, and finally, how to
                    effectively report it if one still thinks it's a new bug.</p>

                <p>This will reduce the noise level for a while, but as the number
                    of users increases, the problem will eventually come back. No
                    individual user can be blamed for it. Each one is just trying to
                    contribute to the project's well-being, and even if their first bug
                    report isn't helpful, you still want to encourage them to stay
                    involved and file better tickets in the future. In the meantime,
                    though, the project needs to keep the ticket database as free of junk
                    as possible.</p>

                <p>The two things that will do the most to prevent this problem
                    are: making sure there are people watching the bug tracker who have
                    enough knowledge to close tickets as invalid or duplicates the moment
                    they come in, and requiring (or strongly encouraging) users to confirm
                    their bugs <span class="emphasis"><em>with other people</em></span> before filing them
                    in the tracker.</p>

                <p>The first technique seems to be used universally. Even projects
                    with huge ticket databases (say, the Debian bug tracker at
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.debian.org/" target="_top">bugs.debian.org</a>, which
                    contained 739,542 tickets as of this writing) still arrange things so that
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> sees each ticket that comes in. It may be
                    a different person depending on the category of the ticket. For
                    example, the Debian project is a collection of software packages, so
                    Debian automatically routes each ticket to the appropriate package
                    maintainers. Of course, users can sometimes misidentify a ticket's
                    category, with the result that the ticket is sent to the wrong person
                    initially, who may then have to reroute it. However, the important
                    thing is that the burden is still sharedâwhether the user
                    guesses right or wrong when filing, ticket watching is still
                    distributed more or less evenly among the developers, so each ticket is
                    able to receive a timely response.</p>

                <p>The second technique is less widespread, probably because it's
                    harder to automate. The essential idea is that every new ticket gets
                    "buddied" into the database. When a user thinks he's found a problem,
                    he is asked to describe it on one of the mailing lists, or in an IRC
                    channel, and get confirmation from someone that it is indeed a bug.
                    Bringing in that second pair of eyes early can prevent a lot of
                    spurious reports. Sometimes the second party is able to identify that
                    the behavior is not a bug, or is fixed in recent releases. Or she may
                    be familiar with the symptoms from a previous ticket, and can prevent a
                    duplicate filing by pointing the user to the older ticket. Often it's
                    enough just to ask the user "Did you search the bug tracker to see if
                    it's already been reported?" Many people simply don't think of that,
                    yet are happy to do the search once they know someone's
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>expecting</em></span> them to.</p>

                <p>The buddy system can really keep the ticket database clean, but
                    it has some disadvantages too. Many people will file solo anyway,
                    either through not seeing, or through disregarding, the instructions
                    to find a buddy for new tickets. Thus it is still necessary for
                    volunteers to watch the ticket database. Furthermore, because most new
                    reporters don't understand how difficult the task of maintaining the
                    ticket database is, it's not fair to chide them too harshly for
                    ignoring the guidelines. Thus the volunteers must be vigilant, and
                    yet exercise restraint in how they bounce unbuddied tickets back to
                    their reporters. The goal is to train each reporter to use the
                    buddying system in the future, so that there is an ever-growing pool
                    of people who understand the ticket-filtering system. On seeing an
                    unbuddied ticket, the ideal steps are:</p>

                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Immediately respond to the ticket, politely thanking the user
                            for filing, but pointing them to the buddying guidelines
                            (which should, of course, be prominently posted on the web
                            site).</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>If the ticket is clearly valid and not a duplicate, approve it
                            anyway, and start it down the normal life cycle. After all,
                            the reporter's now been informed about buddying, so there's
                            no point closing a valid ticket and wasting the work done so
                            far.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Otherwise, if the ticket is not clearly valid, close it, but
                            ask the reporter to reopen it if they get confirmation from
                            a buddy. When they do, they should put a reference to the
                            confirmation thread (e.g., a URL into the mailing list
                            archives).</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>Remember that although this system will improve the signal/noise
                    ratio in the ticket database over time, it will never completely stop
                    the misfilings. The only way to prevent misfilings entirely is to
                    close off the bug tracker to everyone but developersâa cure that
                    is almost always worse than the disease. It's better to accept that
                    cleaning out invalid tickets will always be part of the project's
                    routine maintenance, and to try to get as many people as possible to
                    help.</p>

            <p>Many projects offer real-time chat rooms using
                <em class="firstterm">Internet Relay Chat</em>
                (<em class="firstterm">IRC</em>), forums where users and developers can
                ask each other questions and get instant responses. IRC has been
                around for a long time, and its primarily text-based interface and
                command language can look old-fashioned&nbsp;â&nbsp;but don't be
                fooled: the number of people using IRC continues to
                grow<sup>[<a name="idp6522032" href="#ftn.idp6522032" class="footnote">34</a>]</sup>,
                and it is a key communications forum for many open source projects.
                It's generally the only place where developers can meet in a shared
                space for real-time conversation on a regular basis.</p>

            <p>If you've never used IRC before, don't be daunted. It's not
                hard; although there isn't space in this book for an IRC primer,
                <a class="ulink" href="http://irchelp.org/" target="_top">irchelp.org</a> is a good guide
                to IRC usage and administration, and in particular see the tutorial at
                <a class="ulink" href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html" target="_top">irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html</a>.
                While in theory your
                project <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> run its own IRC servers, it is
                generally not worth the hassle. Instead, just do what everyone else
                does: host your project's IRC channels<sup>[<a name="idp6525984" href="#ftn.idp6525984"
                                                               class="footnote">35</a>]</sup> at Freenode (<a
                        class="ulink" href="http://freenode.net/" target="_top">freenode.net</a>). Freenode gives you
                the control you need to administer your project's IRC channels, while
                sparing you the not-insignificant trouble of maintaining an IRC server
                yourself.</p>

            <p>The first thing to do is choose a channel name. The most
                obvious choice is the name of your projectâif that's available
                at Freenode, then use it. If not, try to choose something as close to
                your project's name, and as easy to remember, as possible. Advertise
                the channel's availabity from your project's web site, so a visitor
                with a quick question will see it right away.<sup>[<a name="idp6517120" href="#ftn.idp6517120"
                                                                      class="footnote">36</a>]</sup>. If your project's
                channel gets
                too noisy, you can divide into multiple channels, for example one for
                installation problems, another for usage questions, another for
                development chat, etc (<a class="xref" href="#growth" title="Handling Growth">the section called
                    âHandling Growthâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#communications"
                                                      title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>
                discusses when and how to divide into multiple channels). But when
                your project is young, there should only be one channel, with everyone
                talking together. Later, as the user-to-developer ratio increases,
                separate channels may become necessary.</p>

            <p>How will people know all the available channels, let alone which
                channel to talk in? And when they talk, how will they know what the
                local conventions are?</p>

            <p>The answer is to tell them by setting the <em class="firstterm">channel
                topic</em>.<sup>[<a name="idp6534800" href="#ftn.idp6534800" class="footnote">37</a>]</sup> The channel
                topic is a brief
                message each user sees when they first enter the channel. It gives
                quick guidance to newcomers, and pointers to further information. For
                example:</p><pre class="screen">The Apache (TM) Subversion (R) version control system

http://subversion.apache.org/faq | Subversion 1.8.8 and 1.7.16 released
</pre>
            <p>That's terse, but it tells newcomers what they need to know. It
                says exactly what the channel is for, gives the project home page (in
                case someone wanders into the channel without having first been to the
                project web site), gives a pointer to some documentation, and gives
                recent release news.</p>

            <div class="sidebar" title="Paste Sites"><a name="paste-sites"></a>

                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><p class="title"><b>Paste Sites</b></p></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>An IRC channel is a shared space: everyone can see what everyone
                    else is saying. Normally, this is a good thing, as it allows people
                    to jump into a conversation when they think they have something to
                    contribute, and allows spectators to learn by watching. But it
                    becomes problematic when someone has to provide a large quantity of
                    information at once, such as a large error message or a transcript
                    from a debugging session, because pasting too many lines of output
                    into the room will disrupt other conversations.</p>

                <p>The solution is to use one of the
                    <em class="firstterm">pastebin</em> or <em class="firstterm">pastebot</em>
                    sites. When requesting a large amount of data from someone, ask them
                    not to paste it into the channel, but instead to go to (for example)
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.ca/" target="_top">pastebin.ca</a>, paste their
                    data into the form there, and tell the resulting new URL to the IRC
                    channel. Anyone can then visit the URL and view the data.</p>

                <p>There are many free paste sites available, far too many for a
                    comprehensive list. Three that I seen used a lot are GitHub Gists
                    (<a class="ulink" href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_top">gist.github.com</a>),
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://paste.lisp.org/" target="_top">paste.lisp.org</a> and <a class="ulink"
                                                                                                           href="http://pastebin.ca/"
                                                                                                           target="_top">pastebin.ca</a>.
                    But there are many
                    other fine ones, and it's okay if different people in your IRC channel
                    choose to use different paste sites.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="IRC Bots">

                </div>
                <a name="bots"></a>

                <p>Many technically-oriented IRC channels have a non-human member,
                    a so-called <em class="firstterm">bot</em>, that is capable of storing and
                    regurgitating information in response to specific commands.
                    Typically, the bot is addressed just like any other member of the
                    channel, that is, the commands are delivered by "speaking to" the bot.
                    For example:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;kfogel&gt; wayita: learn diff-cmd = http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; Thanks!
</pre>
                <p>That told the bot, who is logged into the channel as wayita, to
                    remember a certain URL as the answer to the query "diff-cmd" (wayita
                    responded, confirming with a "Thanks!"). Now we can address wayita,
                    asking the bot to tell another user about diff-cmd:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;kfogel&gt; wayita: tell jrandom about diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; jrandom: http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre>
                <p>The same thing can be accomplished via a convenient shorthand:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;kfogel&gt; !a jrandom diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; jrandom: http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre>
                <p>The exact command set and behaviors differ from bot to bot
                    (unfortunately, the diversity of IRC bot command languages seems to be
                    rivaled only by the diversity of wiki syntaxes). The above example
                    happens to be with <code class="literal">wayita</code> (<a class="ulink"
                                                                               href="http://repos.borg.ch/svn/wayita/trunk/"
                                                                               target="_top">repos.borg.ch/svn/wayita/trunk</a>),
                    of which there is usually an
                    instance running in <code class="literal">#svn</code> at Freenode, but there are
                    many other IRC bots available. Note that no special server privileges
                    are required to run a bot. A bot is just like any other user joining
                    a channel.</p>

                <p>If your channel tends to get the same questions over and over,
                    I highly recommend setting up a bot. Only a small percentage of
                    channel users will acquire the expertise needed to manipulate the bot,
                    but those users will answer a disproportionately high percentage of
                    questions, because the bot enables them to respond so much more
                    efficiently.</p>

                    <a name="cia"></a>

                    <p>You can also configure a bot to watch your project's version
                        control repository and broadcast commit activity to the relevant IRC
                        channels. Though of somewhat less technical utility than commit
                        emails, since observers might or might not be around when a commit
                        notice pops up in IRC, this technique is of immense
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>social</em></span> utility. People get the sense of being
                        part of something alive and active, and feel that they can see
                        progress being made right before their eyes. And because the
                        notifications appear in a shared space, people in the chat room will
                        often react in real time, reviewing the commit and commenting on it on
                        the spot. The technical details of setting this up are beyond the
                        scope of this book, but it's usually worth the effort. This service

                <p>Although it is possible to publicly archive everything that
                    happens in an IRC channel, it's not necessarily expected. IRC
                    conversations are nominally public, but many people think of them as
                    informal and ephemeral conversations. Users may be careless with
                    grammar, and often express opinions (for example, about other software
                    or other programmers) that they wouldn't want preserved forever in a
                    searchable online archive. Of course, there will sometimes be
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>excerpts</em></span> that get quoted elsewhere, and that's
                    fine. But indiscriminate public logging may make some users uneasy.

        <div class="sect1" title="Wikis">

                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="wikis"></a>Wikis</h2></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>When open source software project wikis go bad, they usually go
                bad for the same reasons: lack of consistent organization and editing,
                leading to a mess of outdated and redundant pages, and lack of clarity
                on who the target audience is for a given page or section.</p>

            <p>A well-run wiki can be a wonderful thing for users, however, and
                is worth some effort to maintain. Try to have a clear page
                organization strategy and even a pleasing visual layout, so that
                visitors (i.e., potential editors) will instinctively know how to fit
                their contributions in. Make sure the intended audience is clear at
                all times to all editors. Most importantly, document these standards
                in the wiki itself and point people to them, so editors have somewhere
                to go for guidance. Too often, wiki administrators fall victim to the
                fantasy that because hordes of visitors are individually adding high
                quality content to the site, the sum of all these contributions must
                therefore also be of high quality. That's not how collaborative
                editing works. Each individual page or paragraph may be good when
                considered by itself, but it will not be good if embedded in a
                disorganized or confusing whole.</p>

            <p>In general, wikis will amplify any failings that are present
                from early on, since contributors tend to imitate whatever patterns
                they see in front of them. So don't just set up the wiki and hope
                everything falls into place. You must also prime it with well-written
                content, so people have a template to follow.</p>

            <p>The shining example of a well-run wiki is Wikipedia, of course,
                and in some ways it makes a poor example because it gets so much more
                editorial attention than any other wiki in the world. Still, if you
                examine Wikipedia closely, you'll see that its administrators laid a
                <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> thorough foundation for cooperation. There
                is extensive documentation on how to write new entries, how to
                maintain an appropriate point of view, what sorts of edits to make,
                what edits to avoid, a dispute resolution process for contested edits
                (involving several stages, including eventual arbitration), and so
                forth. They also have authorization controls, so that if a page is
                the target of repeated inappropriate edits, they can lock it down
                until the problem is resolved. In other words, they didn't just throw
                some templates onto a web site and hope for the best. Wikipedia works
                because its founders give careful thought to getting thousands of
                strangers to tailor their writing to a common vision. While you may
                not need the same level of preparedness to run a wiki for a free
                software project, the spirit is worth emulating.</p>

                <p>Never allow open, anonymous editing on your wiki. The days when
                    that was possible are <span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> gone now; today, any
                    open wiki other than Wikipedia will be covered completely with spam in
                    approximately 3 milliseconds. (Wikipedia is an exception because it
                    has an exceptionally large number of readers willing to clean up spam
                    quickly, and because it has a well-funded organization behind it
                    devoted to resisting spam using various large-scale monitoring
                    techniques not practically available to smaller projects.)</p>

                <p>All edits in your project's wiki must come from registered
                    users; if your wiki software doesn't already enforce this by default,
                    then configure it to enforce that. Even then you may need to keep
                    watch for spam edits from users who registered under false pretences
                    for the purpose of spamming.</p></div>

                </div>
                <p>If your project is on GitHub or some other free hosting site,
                    it's usually best to use the built-in wiki feature that most such
                    sites offer. That way your wiki will be automatically integrated with
                    your repository or other project permissions, and you can rely on the
                    site's user account system instead of having a separate registration
                    system for the wiki.</p>

                <p>If you are setting up your own wiki, then you're free to choose
                    which one, and fortunately there are plenty of good free software wiki
                    implementations available. I've had good experience with DokuWiki
                    (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki" target="_top">dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki</a>),
                    but there are many others. There is
                    a wonderful tool called the Wiki Choice Wizard at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/"
                                                                         target="_top">wikimatrix.org</a> that allows
                    you to specify the features you care about (an open source license can
                    be one of them) and then view a chart comparing all the wiki software
                    that meets those criteria. Another good resource is Wikipedia's own
                    list of wikis: <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software"
                                      target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software</a>.</p>

                <p>I do not recommend using MediaWiki (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.mediawiki.org" target="_top">mediawiki.org</a>)
                    as the wiki
                    software for most projects. MediaWiki is the software on which
                    Wikipedia itself runs, and while it is very good at that, its
                    administrative facilities are tuned to the needs of a site unlike any
                    other wiki on the Net&nbsp;â&nbsp;and actually not so well-tuned
                    to the needs of smaller editing communities. Many projects are
                    tempted to choose MediaWiki because they think it will be easier for
                    users who already know its editing syntax from having edited at
                    Wikipedia, but this turns out to be an almost non-existent advantage
                    for several reasons. First, wikis in general, including Wikipedia,
                    are tending toward rich-text in-browser editing anyway, so that no one
                    really needs to learn the underlying wiki syntax unless they aim to be
                    a power user. Second, many other wikis offer a MediaWiki-syntax
                    plugin, so you can have that syntax anyway if you really want it.
                    Third, for those who will use a plaintext syntax instead of rich-text
                    editing, it's better to use a standardized generic markup format like
                    Markdown (<a class="ulink" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_top">daringfireball.net/projects/markdown</a>),
                    which is available in
                    many wikis either natively or via a plugin, than to use a wiki syntax
                    of any flavor. If you support Markdown, then people can edit in your
                    wiki using the same markup syntax they already know from GitHub and
                    other popular tools.</p></div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>In the past few years, online question-and-answer forums (or
                <em class="firstterm">Q&amp;A forums</em>) have gone from being an
                afterthought offered by the occasional project to an increasingly
                expected and normal component of user-facing services. A high-quality
                Q&amp;A forum is like a FAQ with nearly real-time
                updates&nbsp;â&nbsp;indeed, if your Q&amp;A forum is
                sufficiently healthy, it often makes sense to either use it directly
                as your project's FAQ, or have the FAQ consist mostly of pointers to
                the forum's most popular items.</p>

            <p>A project can certainly host its own forums, and many do, using
                free software such as <a class="ulink" href="http://askbot.com" target="_top">Askbot</a>

                                                                                                     target="_top">OSQA</a>,

                                                                                             target="_top">Coordino</a>.
                However, there are also some third-party services
                that aggregate questions and answers, the best-known of which, <a class="ulink"
                                                                                  href="http://stackoverflow.com/"
                                                                                  target="_top">stackoverflow.com</a>,
                frequently
                has its answers coming up first in generic search engine results for
                popular questions.</p>

            <p>While Stack Overflow hosts Q&amp;A about many things, not just
                about open source projects, it seems to have found the right
                combination of cultural guidelines and upvoting/downvoting features to
                enable its contributors to quickly narrow in on good answers for
                questions about open source software in particular. (The questions
                and answers on Stack Overflow are freely licensed, although the code
                that runs the site itself is not open source.) On the other hand,
                projects that host their own Q&amp;A forums are lately doing pretty
                well in search engine results too. It may be that the current
                dominance of Stack Overflow, as of this writing in 2014, is partly
                just an accident of timing, and that the real lesson is that
                Q&amp;A-style forums are an important addition to the free software
                project communications toolbox&nbsp;â&nbsp;one that scales
                better with user base than many other tools do.</p>

            <p>There is no definite answer to the question of whether or when
                you should set up dedicated Q&amp;A forums for your project. It
                depends on available resources, on the type of project, the
                demographics of the user community, etc. But do keep an eye out for
                Stack Overflow results, or other third-party results, coming up in
                generic question-style searches about your project. Their presence may
                indicate that it's time to consider setting up a dedicated Q&amp;A
                forum. Whether you do or not, the project can still learn a lot from
                looking at what people are asking on Stack Overflow, and at the
                responses.</p></div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Perhaps surprisingly for such social endeavors, open source
                projects typically make only limited use of what most people think of
                as "social networking" services. But this seeming omission is really
                a matter of definition: most of the infrastructure that open source
                projects have been using for decades, since long before "social
                networking" became a recognized category of software, is actually
                social networking software even if it isn't called that. The reason
                open source projects tend not to have much presence <span style="color: red">&lt;em&gt;as
projects&lt;/em&gt;</span> on, say, Facebook is just that the services Facebook
                offers are not well-tuned to what open source projects need. On the
                other hand, as you might expect, the infrastructure these projects
                have been using and improving for many years <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
                quite well-tuned to their needs.</p>

            <p>Most projects do use Twitter and similar microblog services,
                because sending out short quips and announcements that can be easily
                forwarded and replied to is a good way for a project to have
                conversations with its community; see LibreOffice's "@AskLibreOffice"
                tweet stream at <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/AskLibreOffice" target="_top">twitter.com/AskLibreOffice</a>
                for an example of this. Projects
                also sometimes use services such as <a class="ulink" href="https://www.eventbrite.com" target="_top">Eventbrite.com</a>
                and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.Meetup.com" target="_top">Meetup.com</a> to arrange in-person
                meetings of users and developers.</p>

            <p>But beyond lightweight services such as those, most free
                software projects do not maintain a large presence on mainstream
                social media platforms (though individual developers sometimes do, of
                course, and they may discuss the project there). The reward the
                project gets in exchange for that investment of time and attention
                appears not to be high enough to be worth the effort.</p></div>

            <p>The first questions people usually ask about free software are
                "How does it work? What keeps a project running? Who makes the
                decisions?" I'm always dissatisfied with bland responses about
                meritocracy, the spirit of cooperation, code speaking for itself, etc.
                The fact is, the question is not easy to answer. Meritocracy,
                cooperation, and running code are all part of it, but they do little
                to explain how projects actually run on a day-to-day basis, and say
                nothing about how conflicts are resolved.</p>

            <p>This chapter tries to show the structural underpinnings
                successful projects have in common. I mean "successful" not just in
                terms of technical quality, but in terms of operational health and
                survivability. Operational health is the project's ongoing ability to
                incorporate new code contributions and new developers, and to be
                responsive to incoming bug reports. Survivability is the project's
                ability to exist independently of any individual participant or
                sponsorâthink of it as the likelihood that the project would
                continue even if all of its founding members were to move on to other
                things<sup>[<a name="idp6530000" href="#ftn.idp6530000" class="footnote">39</a>]</sup>.
                Technical success is not hard to achieve, but without a
                robust developer base and social foundation, a project may be unable
                to handle the growth that initial success brings, or the departure of
                charismatic individuals.</p>

            <p>There are various ways to achieve this kind of success. Some
                involve a formal governance structure, by which debates are resolved,
                new developers are invited in (and sometimes out), new features
                planned, and so on. Others use less formal structure, but more
                self-restraint, to produce an atmosphere of fairness that
                people can rely on as a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> form
                of governance. Both ways lead to the same result: a sense of
                institutional permanence, supported by habits and procedures that are
                well understood by everyone who participates. These features are even
                more important in self-organizing systems than in centrally-controlled
                ones, because in self-organizing systems, everyone is conscious that a
                few bad apples can spoil the whole barrel, at least for a while.</p>

            <div class="sect1" title="Forkability">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>

                </div>
                <p>The indispensable ingredient that binds developers together on a
                    free software project, and makes them willing to compromise when
                    necessary, is the code's <em class="firstterm">forkability</em>: the
                    ability of anyone to take a copy of the source code and use it to
                    start a competing project, known as a <em class="firstterm">fork</em>.
                    The paradoxical thing is that the <span class="emphasis"><em>possibility</em></span> of
                    forks is usually a much greater force in free software projects than
                    actual forks, which are very rare. Because a fork is usually bad for
                    everyone (for reasons examined in detail in
                    <a class="xref" href="#forks" title="Forks">the section called âForksâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>), the more serious
                    the threat of a fork becomes, the more willing people are to
                    compromise to avoid it.</p>

                <p>Forks, or rather the potential for forks, are the reason there
                    are no true dictators in free software projects. This may seem like a
                    surprising claim, considering how common it is to hear someone called
                    the "dictator" (sometimes softened to "benevolent dictator") in a
                    given open source project. But this kind of dictatorship is special,
                    quite different from the conventional understanding of the word.
                    Imagine a king whose subjects could copy his entire kingdom at any
                    time and move to the copy to rule as they see fit. Would not such a
                    king govern very differently from one whose subjects were bound to
                    stay under his rule no matter what he did?</p>

                <p>This is why even projects that are not formally organized as
                    democracies are, in practice, democracies when it comes to important
                    decisions. Replicability implies forkability; forkability implies
                    consensus. It may well be that everyone is willing to defer to one
                    leader (the most famous example being Linus Torvalds in Linux kernel
                    development), but this is because they <span class="emphasis"><em>choose</em></span> to
                    do so, in an entirely non-cynical and non-sinister way. The dictator
                    has no magical hold over the project. A key property of all open
                    source licenses is that they do not give one party more power than any
                    other in deciding how the code can be changed or used. If the dictator
                    were to suddenly start making bad decisions, there would be
                    restlessness, followed eventually by revolt and a fork. Except, of
                    course, that things rarely get that far, because the dictator compromises
                    first.</p>

                <p>But just because forkability puts an upper limit on how much
                    power anyone can exert in a project doesn't mean there aren't
                    important differences in how projects are governed. You don't want
                    every decision to come down to the last-resort question of who might
                    consider a fork. That would get tiresome very quickly, and sap
                    energy away from real work. The next two sections examine different
                    ways to organize projects such that most decisions go smoothly. These
                    two examples are somewhat idealized extremes; many projects fall
                    somewhere along a continuum between them.</p></div>

            <p>The <em class="firstterm">benevolent dictator</em> model is exactly
                what it sounds like: final decision-making authority rests with one
                person, who, by virtue of personality and experience, is expected
                to use it wisely.</p>

            <p>Although "benevolent dictator" (or <em class="firstterm">BD</em>)is
                the standard term for this role, it would be better to think of it as
                "community-approved arbitrator" or "judge". Generally, benevolent
                dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even most of the
                decisions. It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise
                to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project,
                and anyway, quality developers won't stay around unless they have some
                influence on the project's direction. Therefore, benevolent dictators
                commonly do not dictate much. Instead, they let things work
                themselves out through discussion and experimentation whenever
                possible. They participate in those discussions themselves, but as
                regular developers, often deferring to an area maintainer who has more
                expertise. Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached,
                and that most of the group <span class="emphasis"><em>wants</em></span> someone to guide
                the decision so that development can move on, does she put her foot
                down and say "This is the way it's going to be." Reluctance to make
                decisions by fiat is a trait shared by almost all successful
                benevolent dictators; it is one of the reasons they manage to keep the
                role.</p>

                <p>Being a BD requires a combination of traits. It needs, first of
                    all, a well-honed sensitivity to one's own influence in the project,
                    which in turn brings self-restraint. In the early stages of a
                    discussion, one should not express opinions and conclusions with so
                    much certainty that others feel like it's pointless to dissent.
                    People must be free to air ideas, even stupid ideas. It is inevitable
                    that the BD will post a stupid idea from time to time too, of course,
                    and therefore the role also requires an ability to recognize and
                    acknowledge when one has made a bad decisionâthough this is
                    simply a trait that <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> good developer should
                    have, especially if she stays with the project a long time. But the
                    difference is that the BD can afford to slip from time to time without
                    worrying about long-term damage to her credibility. Developers with
                    less seniority may not feel so secure, so the BD should phrase
                    critiques or contrary decisions with some sensitivity for how much
                    weight her words carry, both technically and psychologically.</p>

                <p>The BD does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to have the sharpest
                    technical skills of anyone in the project. She must be skilled enough
                    to work on the code herself, and to understand and comment on any
                    change under consideration, but that's all. The BD position is
                    neither acquired nor held by virtue of intimidating coding skills.
                    What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important is experience and overall
                    design senseânot necessarily the ability to produce good
                    design on demand, but the ability to recognize and endorse good
                    design, whatever its source.</p>

                <p>It is common for the benevolent dictator to be a founder of the
                    project, but this is more a correlation than a cause. The sorts of
                    qualities that make one able to successfully start a
                    projectâtechnical competence, ability to persuade other people
                    to join, and so onâare exactly the qualities any BD would need. And
                    of course, founders start out with a sort of automatic seniority,
                    which can often be enough to make benevolent dictatorship by the
                    founder appear the path of least resistance for all concerned.</p>

                <p>Remember that the potential to fork goes both ways. A BD can
                    fork a project just as easily as anyone else, and some have
                    occasionally done so, when they felt that the direction they wanted to
                    take the project was different from where the majority of other
                    developers wanted to go. Because of forkability, it does not matter
                    whether the benevolent dictator has control over the currently
                    accepted "master" project repository. People sometimes talk of repository
                    control as though it were the ultimate source of power in a project,
                    but in fact it is irrelevant. The ability to add or remove people's
                    commit passwords for one project on a particular hosting site affects
                    only that copy of the project on that site. Prolonged abuse of that
                    power, whether by the BD or someone else, would simply lead to
                    development moving to a different copy of the project.</p></div>
            <p>Whether your project should have a benevolent dictator, or would
                run better with some less centralized form of governance, largely
                depends on who is available to fill the role. As a general rule, if
                it's simply obvious to everyone who should be the BD, then that's the
                way to go. But if no candidate for BD is immediately obvious, then
                the project should probably use a decentralized decision-making
                process, as described in the next section.</p></div>
        <div class="sect1" title="Consensus-based Democracy">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="consensus-democracy"></a>Consensus-based

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>As projects get older, they tend to move away from the
                benevolent dictatorship model and toward more openly democratic
                systems. This is not necessarily out of dissatisfaction with a
                particular BD. It's simply that group-based governance is more
                "evolutionarily stable", to borrow a biological metaphor. Whenever a
                benevolent dictator steps down, or attempts to spread decision-making
                responsibility more evenly, it is an opportunity for the group to
                settle on a new, non-dictatorial systemâestablish a
                constitution, as it were. The group may not take this opportunity the
                first time, or the second, but eventually they will; once they do,
                the decision is unlikely ever to be reversed. Common sense explains
                why: if a group of N people were to vest one person with special
                power, it would mean that N&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 people were each agreeing to
                decrease their individual influence. People usually don't want to do
                that. Even if they did, the resulting dictatorship would still be
                conditional: the group anointed the BD, clearly the group could depose
                the BD. Therefore, once a project has moved from leadership by a
                charismatic individual to a more formal, group-based system, it rarely
                moves back.</p>

            <p>The details of how these systems work vary widely, but there are
                two common elements: one, the group works by consensus most of the
                time; two, there is a formal voting mechanism to fall back on when
                consensus cannot be reached.</p>

            <p><em class="firstterm">Consensus</em> simply means an agreement that
                everyone is willing to live with. It is not an ambiguous state: a
                group has reached consensus on a given question when someone proposes
                that consensus has been reached and no one contradicts the assertion.
                The person proposing consensus should, of course, state specifically
                what the consensus is, and what actions would be taken in consequence
                of it, if those are not obvious.</p>

            <p>Most conversation in a project is on technical topics, such as
                the right way to fix a certain bug, whether or not to add a feature,
                how strictly to document interfaces, etc. Consensus-based governance
                works well because it blends seamlessly with the technical discussion
                itself. By the end of a discussion, there is often general agreement
                on what course to take. Someone will usually make a concluding post,
                which is simultaneously a summary of what has been decided and an
                implicit proposal of consensus. This provides a last chance for
                someone else to say "Wait, I didn't agree to that. We need to hash
                this out some more."</p>

            <p>For small, uncontroversial decisions, the proposal of consensus
                is implicit. For example, when a developer spontaneously commits a
                bugfix, the commit itself is a proposal of consensus: "I assume we all
                agree that this bug needs to be fixed, and that this is the way to fix
                it." Of course, the developer does not actually say that; she just
                commits the fix, and the others in the project do not bother to state
                their agreement, because silence is consent. If someone commits a
                change that turns out <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have consensus, the
                result is simply for the project to discuss the change as though it
                had not already been committed. The reason this works is the topic of
                the next section.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Version Control Means You Can Relax">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="version-control-relaxation"></a>Version Control Means You Can
                            Relax</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The fact that the project's source code is kept under version
                    control means that most decisions can be easily unmade. The most
                    common way this happens is that someone commits a change mistakenly
                    thinking everyone would be happy with it, only to be met with
                    objections after the fact. It is typical for such objections to start
                    out with an obligatory apology for having missed out on prior
                    discussion, though this may be omitted if the objector finds no record
                    of such a discussion in the mailing list archives. Either way, there
                    is no reason for the tone of the discussion to be different after the
                    change has been committed than before. Any change can be
                    reverted<sup>[<a name="idp7168896" href="#ftn.idp7168896" class="footnote">40</a>]</sup>, at least
                    until dependent changes are
                    introduced (i.e., new code that would break if the original change
                    were suddenly removed). The version control system gives the project
                    a way to undo the effects of bad or hasty judgement. This, in turn,
                    frees people to trust their instincts about how much feedback is
                    necessary before doing something.</p>

                <p>This also means that the process of establishing consensus need
                    not be very formal. Most projects handle it by feel. Minor changes
                    can go in with no discussion, or with minimal discussion followed by a
                    few nods of agreement. For more significant changes, especially ones
                    with the potential to destabilize a lot of code, people should wait a
                    day or two before assuming there is consensus, the rationale being
                    that no one should be marginalized in an important conversation simply
                    because he didn't check email frequently enough.</p>

                <p>Thus, when someone is confident she knows what needs to be done,
                    she should just go ahead and do it. This applies not only to software
                    fixes, but to web site updates, documentation changes, and anything
                    else unlikely to be controversial. Usually there will be only a few
                    instances where an action draws disapproval, and these can be handled on
                    a case-by-case basis. Of course, one shouldn't encourage people to be
                    headstrong. There is still a psychological difference between a
                    decision under discussion and one that has already taken effect but is
                    technically reversible. People always feel that momentum is
                    allied to action, and will be slightly more reluctant to revert a
                    change than to prevent it in the first place. If a developer abuses
                    this fact by committing potentially controversial changes too quickly,
                    however, people can and should complain, and hold that developer to a
                    stricter standard until things improve.</p></div>

                </div>
                <p>Inevitably, some debates just won't consense. When all other
                    means of breaking a deadlock fail, the solution is to vote. But
                    before a vote can be taken, there must be a clear set of choices on
                    the ballot. Here, again, the normal process of technical discussion
                    blends serendipitously with the project's decision-making procedures.
                    The kinds of questions that come to a vote often involve complex,
                    multifaceted issues. In any such complex discussion, there are
                    usually one or two people playing the role of <em class="firstterm">honest
                        broker</em>: posting periodic summaries of the various
                    arguments and keeping track of where the core points of disagreement
                    (and agreement) lie. These summaries help everyone measure how much
                    progress has been made toward resolving the issues, and remind
                    everyone of what questions remain to
                    be addressed. Those same summaries can serve as prototypes for a
                    ballot sheet, should a vote become necessary. If the honest brokers
                    have been doing their job well, they will be able to credibly call for
                    a vote when the time comes, and the group will be willing to use a
                    ballot sheet based on their summary of the issues. The brokers
                    themselves may be participants in the debate; it is not necessary for
                    them to remain above the fray, as long as they can understand and
                    fairly represent others' views, and not let their partisan sentiments
                    prevent them from summarizing the state of the debate accurately.</p>

                <p>The actual content of the ballot is usually not controversial
                    By the time matters reach a vote, the disagreement has usually boiled
                    down to a few key issues, with recognizable labels and brief
                    descriptions. Occasionally a developer will object to the form of the
                    ballot itself. Sometimes his concern is legitimate, for example
                    that an important choice was left off or not described accurately.
                    But other times a developer may be merely trying to stave off the
                    inevitable, perhaps knowing that the vote probably won't go his way.

                <p>Remember to specify the voting method, as there are many

                    voter can vote
                    for as many of the choices on the ballot as she likes. Approval
                    voting is simple to explain and to count. See <a class="ulink"

                    for more details about
                    approval voting and other voting systems, but beware the temptation to
                    geek out on voting systems. I did, in the course of researching this
                    paragraph, and I've never been the same since. You can try all sorts
                    of fancy voting methods, for example ones that involve preferential
                    ranking of choices&nbsp;â&nbsp;such as
                    <em class="firstterm">Borda</em>, <em class="firstterm">Condorcet</em>,
                    <em class="firstterm">instant runoff</em>, and <em class="firstterm">single
                        transferable vote</em>&nbsp;â&nbsp;but a famous result
                    known as <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem"
                                target="_top">Arrow's impossibility theorem</a> has already demonstrated that
                    no voting system is perfect. Try to avoid getting into a long debate
                    about which voting system to use (because, of course, you will then
                    find yourself in a debate about which voting system to use to decide
                    the voting system!). Approval voting is a very good choice for the
                    kinds of ballots an open source project is likely to use to resolve
                    technical or procedural questions.</p>

                <p>Finally, conduct votes in public as much as possible. There is
                    no need for secrecy or anonymity in a vote on matters that have been
                    debated publicly anyway. Have each participant post her votes to the
                    project mailing list, so that any observer can tally and check the
                    results for herself, and so that everything is recorded in the
                    archives. If you prefer to use specialized software to conduct the
                    vote, as of this writing in mid-2015 the open source voting system
                    Helios (<a class="ulink" href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/"
                               target="_top">vote.heliosvoting.org</a>) is a good choice and supports approval

                <p>The hardest thing about voting is determining when to do it. In
                    general, taking a vote should be very rareâa last resort for
                    when all other options have failed. Don't think of voting as a great
                    way to resolve debates. It isn't. It ends discussion, and thereby
                    ends creative thinking about the problem. As long as discussion
                    continues, there is the possibility that someone will come up with a
                    new solution everyone likes. This happens surprisingly often: a
                    lively debate can produce a new way of looking at the problem, and
                    lead to a proposal that eventually satisfies everyone. Even when no
                    new proposal arises, it's still usually better to broker a compromise
                    than to hold a vote. After a compromise, everyone is a little bit
                    unhappy, whereas after a vote, some people are unhappy while others
                    are happy. From a political standpoint, the former situation is
                    preferable: at least each person can feel he extracted a price for his
                    unhappiness. He may be dissatisfied, but so is everyone else.</p>

                <p>Voting's only function is that it finally settles a question so
                    everyone can move on. But it settles it by a head count, instead of
                    by rational dialogue leading everyone to the same conclusion. The
                    more experienced people are with open source projects, the less eager
                    I find them to be to settle questions by vote. Instead they will try
                    to explore previously unconsidered solutions, or compromise more
                    severely than they'd originally planned. Various techniques are
                    available to prevent a premature vote. The most obvious is simply to
                    say "I don't think we're ready for a vote yet," and explain why not.
                    Another is to ask for an informal (non-binding) show of hands. If the
                    response clearly tends toward one side or another, this will make some
                    people suddenly more willing to compromise, obviating the need for a
                    formal vote. But the most effective way is simply to offer a new
                    solution, or a new viewpoint on an old suggestion, so that people
                    re-engage with the issues instead of merely repeating the same
                    arguments.</p>

                <p>In certain rare cases, everyone may agree that all the
                    compromise solutions are worse than any of the non-compromise ones.
                    When that happens, voting is less objectionable, both because it is
                    more likely to lead to a superior solution and because people will not
                    be overly unhappy no matter how it turns out. Even then, the vote
                    should not be rushed. The discussion leading up to a vote is what
                    educates the electorate, so stopping that discussion early can lower
                    the quality of the result.</p>

                <p>(Note that this advice to be reluctant to call votes does not

                    the change review process so that everyone can tell how much review a
                    given change has received. It also does not apply to standard

                <p>Having a voting system raises the question of electorate: who
                    gets to vote? This has the potential to be a sensitive issue, because
                    it forces the project to officially recognize some people as being
                    more involved, or as having better judgement, than others.</p>

                <p>The best solution is to simply take an existing distinction,
                    commit access, and attach voting privileges to it. In projects that
                    offer both full and partial commit access, the question of whether
                    partial committers can vote largely depends on the process by which
                    partial commit access is granted. If the project hands it out
                    liberally, for example as a way of maintaining many third-party
                    contributed tools in the repository, then it should be made clear that
                    partial commit access is really just about committing, not voting.
                    The reverse implication naturally holds as well: since full committers
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> have voting privileges, they must be chosen
                    not only as programmers, but as members of the electorate. If someone
                    shows disruptive or obstructionist tendencies on the mailing list, the
                    group should be very cautious about making him a committer, even if
                    the person is technically skilled.</p>

                <p>The voting system itself should be used to choose new
                    committers, both full and partial. But here is one of the rare
                    instances where secrecy is appropriate. You can't have votes about
                    potential committers posted to a public mailing list, because the
                    candidate's feelings (and reputation) could be hurt. Instead, the
                    usual way is that an existing committer posts to a private mailing
                    list consisting only of the other committers, proposing that someone
                    be granted commit access. The other committers speak their minds
                    freely, knowing the discussion is private. Often there will be no
                    disagreement, and therefore no vote necessary. After waiting a few
                    days to make sure every committer has had a chance to respond, the
                    proposer mails the candidate and offers him commit access. If there
                    is disagreement, discussion ensues as for any other question, possibly
                    resulting in a vote. For this process to be open and frank, the mere
                    fact that the discussion is taking place at all should be secret. If
                    the person under consideration knew it was going on, and then were
                    never offered commit access, he could conclude that he had lost
                    the vote, and would likely feel hurt. Of course, if someone
                    explicitly asks for commit access, then there is no choice but to
                    consider the proposal and explicitly accept or reject him. If the
                    latter, then it should be done as politely as possible, with a clear
                    explanation: "We liked your patches, but haven't seen enough of them
                    yet," or "We appreciate all your patches, but they required
                    considerable adjustments before they could be applied, so we don't
                    feel comfortable giving you commit access yet. We hope that this will
                    change over time, though." Remember, what you're saying could come as
                    a blow, depending on the person's level of confidence. Try to see it
                    from their point of view as you write the mail.</p>

                <p>Because adding a new committer is more consequential than most
                    other one-time decisions, some projects have special requirements for
                    the vote. For example, they may require that the proposal receive at
                    least <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> positive votes and no negative votes, or
                    that a supermajority vote in favor. The exact parameters are not
                    important; the main idea is to get the group to be careful about
                    adding new committers. Similar, or even stricter, special requirements
                    can apply to votes to <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> a committer, though
                    hopefully that will never be necessary. See <a class="xref" href="#committers" title="Committers">the

                <p>For certain kinds of votes, it may be useful to expand the
                    electorate. For example, if the developers simply can't figure out
                    whether a given interface choice matches the way people actually use
                    the software, one solution is to ask to all the subscribers of the
                    project's mailing lists to vote. These are really
                    <em class="firstterm">polls</em> rather than votes, but the developers may
                    choose to treat the result as binding. As with any poll, be sure to
                    make it clear to the participants that there's a write-in option: if
                    someone thinks of a better option not offered in the poll questions,
                    her response may turn out to be the most important result of the
                    poll.</p></div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Some projects allow a special kind of vote known as a
                    <em class="firstterm">veto</em>. A veto is a way for a developer to put a
                    halt to a hasty or ill-considered change, at least long enough for
                    everyone to discuss it more. Think of a veto as somewhere between a
                    very strong objection and a filibuster. Its exact meaning varies from
                    one project to another. Some projects make it very difficult to
                    override a veto; others allow them to be overridden by regular
                    majority vote, perhaps after an enforced delay for more discussion.
                    Any veto should be accompanied by a thorough explanation; a veto
                    without such an explanation should be considered invalid on
                    arrival.</p>

                <p>With vetoes comes the problem of veto abuse. Sometimes
                    developers are too eager to raise the stakes of disagreement by
                    casting a veto, when
                    really all that was called for was more discussion. You can prevent
                    veto abuse by being very reluctant to use vetoes yourself, and by
                    gently calling it out when someone else uses her veto too often. If
                    necessary, you can also remind the group that vetoes are binding for
                    only as long as the group agrees they areâafter all, if a
                    clear majority of developers wants X, then X is going to happen one
                    way or another. Either the vetoing developer will back down, or the
                    group will decide to weaken the meaning of a veto.</p>

                <p>You may see people write "-1" to express a veto. This usage
                    originally comes from the Apache Software Foundation (which has a
                    highly structured voting and veto process, described at <a class="ulink"
                                                                               href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html"
                                                                               target="_top">apache.org/foundation/voting.html</a>),
                    but has since spread to
                    many other projects&nbsp;â&nbsp;albeit not always with exactly
                    the same formal meaning as at the ASF. Technically, "-1" does not
                    always indicate a formal veto even according to the Apache standards,
                    but informally it is usually taken to mean a veto, or at least a very
                    strong objection.</p>

                <p>Like votes, vetoes can apply retroactively. It's not okay to
                    object to a veto on the grounds that the change in question has
                    already been committed, or the action taken (unless it's something
                    irrevocable, like putting out a press release). On the other hand, a
                    veto that arrives weeks or months late isn't likely to be taken very
                    seriously, nor should it be.</p></div>

            <p>At some point, the number of conventions and agreements floating
                around in your project may become so great that you need to record it
                somewhere. In order to give such a document legitimacy, make it clear
                that it is based on mailing list discussions and on agreements already
                in effect. As you compose it, link to the relevant threads in the
                mailing list archives, and whenever there's a point you're not sure
                about, ask again. The document should not contain any surprises:
                remember, it
                is not the source of the agreements, it is merely a description of
                them. Of course, if it is successful, people will start citing it as
                a source of authority in itself, but that just means it reflects the
                overall will of the group accurately.</p>

                </div>
                <p>When you link to an email thread in the archives, it's a good
                    practice to give not only the thread's URL, but the subject, sender
                    name, and date of the first message in the thread (or at least of some
                    message in the thread). The reason is that archives sometimes
                    move&nbsp;â&nbsp;surprisingly often,
                    actually&nbsp;â&nbsp;and the URL alone will usually not contain
                    enough information to find the message or thread in its new
                    location.</p>

                <p>The same advice could apply to bug tickets too, but in practice
                    bug trackers move less often than mail archives do, and when a bug
                    tracker moves the project usually manages to either preserve the
                    ticket numbers or make a mapping between old and new ticket numbers,
                    so that old references can be resolved with a little extra effort.
                    For various technical reasons, this is harder to do with emails and
                    especially with threads, so the better solution is just for references
                    to include enough information to do a search in the new archive if
                    necessary. See also <a class="xref" href="#using-archives" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">the
                        section called âConspicuous Use of Archivesâ</a>.</p></div>
            <p>This is the document alluded to in <a class="xref" href="#developer-guidelines"

<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>. Naturally, when the
                project is very young, you will have to lay down guidelines without
                the benefit of a long project history to draw on. But as the
                development community matures, you can adjust the language to reflect
                the way things actually turn out.</p>

            <p>Don't try to be comprehensive. No document can capture
                everything people need to know about participating in a project. Many
                of the conventions a project evolves remain forever unspoken, never
                mentioned explicitly, yet adhered to by all. Other things are simply
                too obvious to be mentioned, and would only distract from important
                but non-obvious material. For example, there's no point writing
                guidelines like "Be polite and respectful to others on the mailing
                lists, and don't start flame wars," or "Write clean, readable bug-free
                code." Of course these things are desirable, but since there's no
                conceivable universe in which they might <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
                desirable, they are not worth mentioning. If people are being rude on
                the mailing list, or writing buggy code, they're not going to stop
                just because the project guidelines said to. Such situations need to
                be dealt with as they arise, not by blanket admonitions to be good.
                On the other hand, if the project has specific guidelines about
                <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to write good code, such as rules about
                documenting every API in a certain format, then those guidelines
                should be written down as completely as possible.</p>

            <p>A good way to determine what to include is to base the document
                on the questions that newcomers ask most often, and on the complaints
                experienced developers make most often. This doesn't necessarily mean
                it should turn into a FAQ sheetâit probably needs a more
                coherent narrative structure than FAQs can offer. But it should
                follow the same reality-based principle of addressing the issues that
                actually arise, rather than those you anticipate might arise.</p>

            <p>If the project is a benevolent dictatorship, or has officers
                endowed with special powers (president, chair, whatever), then the
                document is also a good opportunity to codify succession procedures.
                Sometimes this can be as simple as naming specific people as
                replacements in case the BD suddenly leaves the project for any
                reason. Generally, if there is a BD, only the BD can get away with
                naming a successor. If there are elected officers, then the
                nomination and election procedure that was used to choose them in the
                first place should be described in the document. If there was no
                procedure originally, then get consensus on a procedure on the mailing
                lists <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> writing about it. People can
                sometimes be touchy about hierarchical structures, so the subject
                needs to be approached with sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most important thing is to make it clear that the
                rules can be reconsidered. If the conventions described in the
                document start to hamper the project, remind everyone that it is
                supposed to be a living reflection of the group's intentions, not a
                source of frustration and blockage. If someone makes a habit of
                inappropriately asking for rules to be reconsidered every time the
                rules get in her way, you don't always need to debate it with
                herâsometimes silence is the best tactic. If other people
                agree with the complaints, they'll chime in, and it will be obvious
                that something needs to change. If no one else agrees, then the
                person won't get much response, and the rules will stay as they
                are.</p>

            <p>Three good examples of project guidelines are the LibreOffice

                The ASF is
                really a collection of software projects, legally organized as a
                nonprofit corporation, so its documents tend to describe governance
                procedures more than development conventions. They're still worth
                reading, though, because they represent the accumulated experience of
                a lot of open source projects.</p></div>

            <p>Successful open source projects often get to a point where they
                feel the need for some sort of formal existence as a legal
                entity&nbsp;â&nbsp;to be able to accept donations (see
                <a class="xref" href="#money" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Money">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Money</i></a> for
                discussion of how to handle incoming
                funding), to purchase and maintain infrastructure for the project's
                benefit, to organize conferences and developer meetups, to enforce
                trademarks, etc.</p>

            <p>There may be a few exceptional circumstances where forming your
                own organization from scratch would be the right solution, but for
                most projects it is much better to join an existing organization.
                There are umbrella organizations whose purpose is to provide a legal
                home for open source projects. Working with multiple projects gives
                these organizations economies of scale and broad
                experience&nbsp;â&nbsp;any of them would almost certainly do a
                better job of providing services to your project than your project
                could manage if it started its own organization.</p>

            <p>Here are some well-known and reputable umbrella organizations:</p>

            <p>These are all based in the United States, but there are similar
                umbrella organizations outside the U.S.&nbsp;â&nbsp;I just
                didn't know them well enough to make recommendations. If you're a
                U.S. reader, remember that the distinctions the U.S. tax code makes
                between different types of non-profit corporations, such as 501(c)(3)
                tax-exempt organizations vs 501(c)(6) trade associations, may not be
                meaningful to members of your project outside the U.S., and that the
                tax benefits available to donors under 501(c)(3) won't apply to
                non-U.S. donors anyway.</p>

            <p>If your project joins or creats a non-profit organization, make
                clear the separation between the legal infrastructure and the
                day-to-day running of the project. The organization is there to
                handle things the developers don't want to handle, not to interfere
                with the things the developers <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> want to handle
                and are already competent to handle. Even if the non-profit becomes
                the official owner of the project's copyrights, trademarks, and other
                assets, that shouldn't change the way decisions are made about
                technical questions, project direction, etc. One of the reasons to
                join one of the existing organizations is that they already have
                experience with this distinction, and know how to fairly read the will
                of the project even when there is controversy or strong disagreement.
                They also serve as a neutral place for resolving disagreements about
                how to allocate the project's money or other resources. More than one
                of the organizations above has had to play "project psychotherapist"
                on occasion, and their ability to do so should be considered an
                advantage even by a healthy and smoothly functioning project.</p></div>

            <p>This chapter examines how to use money constructively in a free
                software environment. It is aimed not only at developers who are paid
                to work on open source projects, but also at their managers (and even
                on up to the executives), who need to understand the social dynamics
                of the development environment and how money affects them.</p>

            <p>Sometimes people are surprised to learn that most free software
                is written by paid developers, not by volunteers. But when you think
                about it, it makes sense: a company often needs a particular piece of
                software to exist, and to be maintained and developed, and yet does
                not need a monopoly on that software. Lots of companies have web
                sites and therefore need a web server; far fewer companies need
                exclusive control over the development of their web server, or need to
                sell it on a proprietary basis. The same is true of office software
                suites, operating system kernels, network connectivity tools,
                educational programs, etc&nbsp;â&nbsp;just as historically it
                has been true of electric grids, roads, sewer systems, and other goods
                that everyone needs but no one needs to own. Just as we expect road
                workers to be paid, we should expect software developers to be paid as
                well.</p>

            <p>Even in the early days of free software, although the proportion
                of truly unpaid volunteers was certainly higher, there were also paid
                developers&nbsp;â&nbsp;and a good deal of informal subsidy as
                well, as there continues to be today. When a system administrator
                writes a network analysis tool to help her do her job, then posts it
                online and gets bug fixes and feature contributions from other system
                administrators, what's happened is that an unofficial consortium has
                been formed. The consortium's funding comes from the sysadmins'
                salaries, and its office space and network bandwidth are donated,
                albeit unknowingly, by the organizations they work for. Those
                organizations benefitted from the investment, of course, although they
                may not be institutionally aware of it at first.</p>

            <p>Today these efforts tend to be more formalized. Corporations
                have become conscious of the benefits of open source software, and now
                involve themselves directly in its development. Developers too have
                come to expect that really important projects will attract funding in
                one way or another. The question is just how the hierarchical command
                structures of corporations and the semi-decentralized, non-coercive
                communities of free software projects can work productively with each
                other&nbsp;â&nbsp;and more or less agree on what "productively"
                means.</p>

            <p>Financial backing is generally welcomed by open source
                development communities. Paid developers mean that bug reports are
                more likely to be listened to, that needed work is more likely to get
                done, and that the project will be less vulnerable to the Forces of
                Chaos (e.g., a key founding developer suddenly losing interest).
                After all, credibility is contagious, to a point. When, for example,
                Google backs an open source project, people assume the project will
                have the chance to succeed or fail on its merits, with adequate
                support in its early stages; their resultant willingness to devote
                effort to it can then make this a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

            <p>However, funding can also bring a perception of control. If not
                handled carefully, money can divide a project into in-group and
                out-group developers. If developers who aren't officially paid to
                work on the project get the feeling that design decisions or feature
                additions are simply available to the highest bidder, they'll head off
                to a project that seems more like a meritocracy and less like unpaid
                labor for someone else's benefit. They may never complain overtly on
                the mailing lists. Instead, there will simply be less and less noise
                from external sources, as the volunteers gradually stop trying to be
                taken seriously. The buzz of small-scale activity will continue, in
                the form of bug reports and occasional small fixes. But there won't
                be any large code contributions or outside participation in design
                discussions. People sense what's expected of them, and live up (or
                down) to those expectations.</p>

            <p>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
                can't buy influence. It most certainly can. The trick is that it
                can't buy influence directly. In a straightforward commercial
                transaction, you trade money for what you want. If you need a feature
                added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and (if all goes well) the
                work gets done and the feature eventually lands in the product. In an
                open source project, it's not so simple. You may sign a contract with
                some developers, but they'd be fooling themselvesâand
                youâif they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be
                accepted by the development community simply because you paid for it.
                The work can only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits
                into the community's vision for the software. You may have some say
                in that vision, but you won't be the only voice.</p>

            <p>So money can't purchase influence, but it can purchase things
                that <span class="emphasis"><em>lead to</em></span> influence. The most obvious example
                is programmers. If you hire good programmers, and they stick around
                long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
                community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
                any other member. They will have a vote, or if there are many of
                them, they will have a voting bloc. If they are respected in the
                project, they will have influence beyond just their votes. There is
                no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either. After
                all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
                reason. Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
                else's. It's just that the weight given to your company's goals will
                be determined by its representatives' status in the project, not by
                your company's size, budget, or business plan.<sup>[<a name="idp7381120" href="#ftn.idp7381120"

            <p>There are many different reasons open source projects get
                corporate support. This list is just a high-level survey. The items
                in it aren't mutually exclusive; often a project's financial backing
                will result from several, or even all, of these motivations:</p>

                    <dd><p>Separate organizations with related software needs often
                        find themselves duplicating effort, either by redundantly writing
                        similar code in-house, or by purchasing similar products from
                        proprietary vendors. When they realize what's going on, the
                        organizations may pool their resources and create (or join) an
                        open source project tailored to their needs. The advantages are
                        obvious: the costs of development are divided, but the benefits
                        accrue to all. Although this scenario might seem most intuitive for
                        nonprofits, it often makes strategic sense even for for-profit

                        offering software under a traditional proprietary license for
                        customers who want to resell it as part of a proprietary
                        application of their own, and simultaneously under a free license
                        for those willing to use it under open source terms (see <a class="xref" href="#dual-licensing">the
                            section called âProprietary Relicensing Schemesâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
                                                                                             title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10,
                            <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a></span>). If the open
                        source developer
                        community is active, the software gets the benefits of wide-area
                        debugging and development, yet the company still gets a royalty
                        stream to support some full-time programmers.</p>

                        <p>Dual-licensing is controversial because it is not a "pure
                            open source play" (as we say in business-speak), but rather yokes
                            funding for open source development to a monopoly-based revenue
                            stream. Whether this is a problem for you depends on where you
                            fall on the "open source is just a way of software development"
                            to "open source is a way of life" spectrum. The presence of
                            revenue from a proprietary version does not necessarily mean that
                            the free software version is worse off, and some very well-known
                            and widely-used free software has had corresponding proprietary
                            versions (<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL"
                                         target="_top">MySQL</a> is probably the most famous example). However,
                            some developers dislike the thought that their contributions may
                            end up in the proprietary version. Also, the mere presence of
                            the proprietary version suggests the possibility that some of the
                            best salaried developers' attention is going to the proprietary
                            code, not the open source code, and this can undermine other
                            developers' faith in the open source project.</p>

                        <p>None of is meant to persuade you not to do dual-licensing.
                            You should just be aware that dual-licensing strategies are
                            unlike the other business approaches I've listed here, and that
                            it probably requires more care and sophistication to manage

            <p>A funder's business model is not the only factor in how that
                funder relates to an open source community. The historical relationship
                between the two also matters: did the company start the project, or is
                it joining an existing development effort? In both cases, the funder
                will have to earn credibility, but, not surprisingly, there's a bit
                more earning to be done in the latter case. The organization needs to
                have clear goals with respect to the project. Is the company trying
                to keep a position of leadership, or simply trying to be one voice in
                the community, to guide but not necessarily govern the project's
                direction? Or does it just want to have a couple of committers
                around, able to fix customers' bugs and get the changes into the
                public distribution without any fuss?</p>

                involvement in a free software project, but every project is a human

                you will always have to play by ear, but following these principles

            <p>If you're managing programmers on an open source project, keep
                them there long enough that they acquire both technical and political
                expertiseâa couple of years, at a minimum. Of course, no
                project, whether open or closed-source, benefits from swapping
                programmers in and out too often. The need for a newcomer to learn
                the ropes each time would be a deterrent in any environment. But the
                penalty is even stronger in open source projects, because outgoing
                developers take with them not only their knowledge of the code, but
                also their status in the community and the human relationships they
                have made there.</p>

            <p>The credibility a developer has accumulated cannot be
                transferred. To pick the most obvious example, an incoming developer
                can't inherit commit access from an outgoing one (see
                <a class="xref" href="#money-vs-love" title="Money Can't Buy You Love">the section called âMoney Can't
                    Buy You Loveâ</a> later in this chapter), so if the
                new developer doesn't already have commit access, he will have to
                submit patches until he does. But commit access is only the most
                easily quantifiable manifestation of lost influence. A long-time developer
                also knows all the old arguments that have been hashed and rehashed on
                the discussion lists. A new developer, having no memory of those
                conversations, may try to raise the topics again, leading to a loss of
                credibility for your organization; the others might wonder "Can't
                they remember anything?" A new developer will also have no political
                feel for the project's personalities, and will not be able to
                influence development directions as quickly or as smoothly as one
                who's been around a long time.</p>

            <p>Train newcomers through a program of supervised engagement. The
                new developer should be in direct contact with the public development
                community from the very first day, starting off with bug fixes and
                cleanup tasks, so he can learn the code base and acquire a reputation
                in the community, yet not spark any long and involved design
                discussions. All the while, one or more experienced developers should
                be available for questioning, and should be reading every post the
                newcomer makes to the development lists, even if they're in threads
                that the experienced developers normally wouldn't pay attention to.
                This will help the group spot potential rocks before the newcomer runs
                aground. Private, behind-the-scenes encouragement and pointers can
                also help a lot, especially if the newcomer is not accustomed to
                massively parallel peer review of his code.</p>

                <p>At CollabNet, when we hired a new developer to work on
                    Subversion, we would sit down together and pick some open bugs for the
                    new person to cut his teeth on. We'll discuss the technical outlines
                    of the solutions, and then assign at least one experienced developer
                    to (publicly) review the patches that the new developer would (also
                    publicly) post. We typically didn't even look at the patch before the
                    main development list saw it, although we could if there were some
                    reason to. The important thing is that the new developer go through
                    the process of public review, learning the code base while
                    simultaneously becoming accustomed to receiving critiques from
                    complete strangers. But we also tried to coordinate the timing so
                    that our own review came immediately after the posting of the patch.
                    That way the first review the list sees is ours, which can help set
                    the tone for the others' reviews. It also contributes to the idea
                    that this new person is to be taken seriously: if others see that
                    we're putting in the time to give detailed reviews, with thorough
                    explanations and references into the archives where appropriate,
                    they'll appreciate that a form of training is going on, and that it
                    probably signifies a long-term investment. This can make them more
                    positively disposed toward the developer, to the degree of spending a
                    little extra time answering questions and reviewing patches
                    themselves.</p></div>

            <p>Your developers should strive to appear in the project's public
                forums as individual participants, rather than as a monolithic
                corporate presence. This is not because there is some negative
                connotation inherent in monolithic corporate presences (well, perhaps
                there is, but that's not what this book is about). Rather, it's
                because individuals are the only sort of entity open source projects
                are structurally equipped to deal with. An individual contributor can
                have discussions, submit patches, acquire credibility, vote, and so
                forth. A company cannot.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, by behaving in a decentralized manner, you avoid
                stimulating centralization of opposition. Let your developers
                disagree with each other on the mailing lists. Encourage them to
                review each other's code as often, and as publicly, as they would
                anyone else's. Discourage them from always voting as a bloc, because
                if they do, others may start to feel that, just on general principles,
                there should be an organized effort to keep them in check.</p>

            <p>There's a difference between actually being decentralized and
                simply striving to appear that way. Under certain circumstances,
                having your developers behave in concert can be quite useful, and they
                should be prepared to coordinate behind the scenes when necessary.
                For example, when making a proposal, having several people chime in
                with agreement early on can help it along, by giving the impression of
                a growing consensus. Others will feel that the proposal has momentum,
                and that if they were to object, they'd be stopping that momentum.
                Thus, people will object only if they have a good reason to do so.
                There's nothing wrong with orchestrating agreement like this, as long
                as objections are still taken seriously. The public manifestations of
                a private agreement are no less sincere for having been coordinated
                beforehand, and are not harmful as long as they are not used to
                prejudicially snuff out opposing arguments. Their purpose is merely
                to inhibit the sort of people who like to object just to stay in
                shape; see <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">the

            <p>Be as open about your organization's goals as you can without
                compromising business secrets. If you want the project to acquire a
                certain feature because, say, your customers have been clamoring for
                it, just say so outright on the mailing lists. If the customers wish
                to remain anonymous, as is sometimes the case, then at least ask them
                if they can be used as unnamed examples. The more the public
                development community knows about <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you want
                what you want, the more comfortable they'll be with whatever you're
                proposing.</p>

            <p>This runs counter to the instinctâso easy to acquire, so
                hard to shake offâthat knowledge is power, and that the more
                others know about your goals, the more control they have over you.
                But that instinct would be wrong here. By publicly advocating the
                feature (or bugfix, or whatever it is), you have
                <span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> laid your cards on the table. The only
                question now is whether you will succeed in guiding the community to
                share your goal. If you merely state that you want it, but can't
                provide concrete examples of why, your argument is weak, and people
                will start to suspect a hidden agenda. But if you give just a few
                real-world scenarios showing why the proposed feature is important,
                that can have a dramatic effect on the debate.</p>

            <p>To see why this is so, consider the alternative. Too
                frequently, debates about new features or new directions are long and
                tiresome. The arguments people advance often reduce to "I personally
                want X," or the ever-popular "In my years of experience as a software
                designer, X is extremely important to users" or "...is a useless frill
                that will please no one." Predictably, the absence of real-world usage
                data neither shortens nor tempers such debates, but instead allows
                them to drift farther and farther from any mooring in actual user
                experience. Without some countervailing force, the end result is
                likely to be determined by whoever was the most articulate, or
                the most persistent, or the most senior.</p>

            <p>As an organization with plentiful customer data available, you
                have the opportunity to provide just such a countervailing force. You
                can be a conduit for information that might otherwise have no means of
                reaching the development community. The fact that the information
                supports your desires is nothing to be embarrassed about. Most
                developers don't individually have very broad experience with how the
                software they write is used. Each developer uses the software in
                her own idiosyncratic way; as far as other usage patterns go, she's
                relying on intuition and guesswork, and deep down, she knows
                this. By providing credible data about a significant number of users,
                you are giving the public development community something akin to
                oxygen. As long as you present it right, they will welcome it
                enthusiastically, and it will propel things in the direction you want
                to go.</p>

            <p>The key, of course, is presenting it right. It will never do to
                insist that simply because you deal with a large number of users, and
                because they need (or think they need) a given feature, therefore
                your solution ought to be implemented. Instead, you should focus your
                initial posts on the problem, rather than on one particular solution.
                Describe in great detail the experiences your customers are
                encountering, offer as much analysis as you have available, and as
                many reasonable solutions as you can think of. When people start
                speculating about the effectiveness of various solutions, you can
                continue to draw on your data to support or refute what they say. You
                may have one particular solution in mind all along, but don't single
                it out for special consideration at first. This is not deception, it
                is simply standard "honest broker" behavior. After all, your true
                goal is to solve the problem; a solution is merely a means to that
                end. If the solution you prefer really is superior, other developers
                will recognize that on their own eventuallyâand then they will
                get behind it of their own free will, which is much better than you
                browbeating them into implementing it. (There is also the possibility
                that they will think of a better solution.)</p>

            <p>This is not to say that you can't ever come out in favor of a
                specific solution. But you must have the patience to see the analysis
                you've already done internally repeated on the public development
                lists. Don't post saying "Yes, we've been over all that here, but it
                doesn't work for reasons A, B, and C. When you get right down to it,
                the only way to solve this is Q." The problem is not so much that it
                sounds arrogant as that it gives the impression that you have
                <span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> devoted some unknown (but, people will
                presume, large) amount of analytical resources to the problem, behind
                closed doors. It makes it seem as though efforts have been going on,
                and perhaps decisions made, that the public is not privy toâand
                that is a recipe for resentment.</p>

            <p>Naturally, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> know how much effort you've
                devoted to the problem internally, and that knowledge is, in a way, a
                disadvantage. It puts your developers in a slightly different mental
                space than everyone else on the mailing lists, reducing their ability
                to see things from the point of view of those who haven't yet thought
                about the problem as much. The earlier you can get everyone else
                thinking about things in the same terms as you do, the smaller this
                distancing effect will be. This logic applies not only to individual
                technical situations, but to the broader mandate of making your goals
                as clear as you can. The unknown is always more destabilizing than
                the known. If people understand why you want what you want, they'll
                feel comfortable talking to you even when they disagree. If they
                can't figure out what makes you tick, they'll assume the worst, at
                least some of the time.</p>

            <p>You won't be able to publicize everything, of course, and people
                won't expect you to. All organizations have secrets; perhaps
                for-profits have more of them, but nonprofits have them too. If you
                must advocate a certain course, but can't reveal anything about why,
                then simply offer the best arguments you can under that handicap, and
                accept the fact that you may not have as much influence as you want in
                the discussion. This is one of the compromises you make in order to
                have a development community not on your payroll.</p></div>

            <p>If you're a paid developer on a project, then set guidelines
                early on about what the money can and cannot buy. This does not mean
                you need to post twice a day to the mailing lists reiterating your
                noble and incorruptible nature. It merely means that you should be on
                the lookout for opportunities to defuse the tensions that
                <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be created by money. You don't need to
                start out assuming that the tensions are there; you do need to
                demonstrate an awareness that they have the potential to arise.</p>

            <p>A perfect example of this came up early in the Subversion project.
                Subversion was started in 2000 by <a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/"
                                                     target="_top">CollabNet</a>, which has been the
                project's primary funder since its inception, paying the salaries of
                several developers (disclaimer: I'm one of them). Soon after the
                project began, we hired another developer, Mike Pilato, to join the
                effort. By then, coding had already started. Although Subversion was
                still very much in the early stages, it already had a development
                community with a set of basic ground rules.</p>

            <p>Mike's arrival raised an interesting question. Subversion
                already had a policy about how a new developer gets commit access.
                First, he submits some patches to the development mailing list. After
                enough patches have gone by for the other committers to see that the
                new contributor knows what he's doing, someone proposes that he just
                commit directly (that proposal is private, as described in <a class="xref" href="#committers"
                                                                              title="Committers">the section called
                    âCommittersâ</a>). Assuming the committers agree, one of
                them mails the new developer and offers him direct commit access to
                the project's repository.</p>

            <p>CollabNet had hired Mike specifically to work on Subversion.
                Among those who already knew him, there was no doubt about his coding
                skills or his readiness to work on the project. Furthermore, the
                volunteer developers had a very good relationship with the CollabNet
                employees, and most likely would not have objected if we'd just given
                Mike commit access the day he was hired. But we knew we'd be setting
                a precedent. If we granted Mike commit access by fiat, we'd be saying
                that CollabNet had the right to ignore project guidelines, simply
                because it was the primary funder. While the damage from this would
                not necessarily be immediately apparent, it would gradually result in
                the non-salaried developers feeling disenfranchised. Other people
                have to earn their commit accessâCollabNet just buys
                it.</p>

            <p>So Mike agreed to start out his employment at CollabNet like any
                other volunteer developer, without commit access. He sent patches to
                the public mailing list, where they could be, and were, reviewed by
                everyone. We also said on the list that we were doing things this way
                deliberately, so there could be no missing the point. After a couple
                of weeks of solid activity by Mike, someone (I can't remember if it
                was a CollabNet developer or not) proposed him for commit access, and
                he was accepted, as we knew he would be.</p>

            <p>That kind of consistency gets you a credibility that money could
                never buy. And credibility is a valuable currency to have in
                technical discussions: it's immunization against having one's motives
                questioned later. In the heat of argument, people will sometimes look
                for non-technical ways to win the battle. The project's primary
                funder, because of its deep involvement and obvious concern over the
                directions the project takes, presents a wider target than most. By
                being scrupulous to observe all project guidelines right from the
                start, the funder makes itself the same size as everyone else.</p>

                for a similar story about commit access. Cooper was then Sun
                Microsystem's "Open Source Diva"âI believe that was her official
                titleâand in the blog entry, she describes how the Tomcat
                development community got Sun to hold its own developers to the same
                commit-access standards as the non-Sun developers.)</p>

            <p>The need for the funders to play by the same rules as everyone
                else means that the Benevolent Dictatorship governance model (see
                <a class="xref" href="#benevolent-dictator" title="Benevolent Dictators">the section called âBenevolent
                    Dictatorsâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>) is slightly
                harder to pull
                off in the presence of funding, particularly if the dictator works for
                the primary funder. Since a dictatorship has few rules, it is hard
                for the funder to prove that it's abiding by community standards, even
                when it is. It's certainly not impossible; it just requires a project
                leader who is able to see things from the point of view of the outside
                developers, as well as that of the funder, and act accordingly. Even
                then, it's probably a good idea to have a proposal for non-dictatorial
                governance sitting in your back pocket, ready to be brought out the
                moment there are any indications of widespread dissatisfaction in the
                community.</p></div>

                    <div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="contracting"></a>Contracting</h2></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Contracted work needs to be handled carefully in free software
                projects. Ideally, if you hire a contractor you want her work to be
                accepted by the community and folded into the public distribution. In
                theory, it wouldn't matter who the contractor is, as long as her work
                is good and meets the project's guidelines. Theory and practice can
                sometimes match, too: a complete stranger who shows up with a good
                patch <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> generally be able to get it into the
                software. The trouble is, it's very hard to produce an acceptable
                patch for a non-trivial enhancement or new feature while truly being a
                complete stranger; one must first discuss it with the rest of the
                project. The duration of that discussion cannot be precisely
                predicted. If the contractor is paid by the hour, you may end up
                paying more than you expected; if she is paid a flat sum, she may end
                up doing more work than she can afford.</p>

            <p>There are two ways around this. The preferred way is to make an
                educated guess about the length of the discussion process, based on
                past experience, add in some padding for error, and base the contract
                on that. It also helps to divide the problem into as many small,
                independent chunks as possible, to increase the predictability of each
                chunk. The other way is to contract solely for delivery of a patch,
                and treat the patch's acceptance into the public project as a separate
                matter. Then it becomes much easier to write the contract, but you're
                stuck with the burden of maintaining a private patch for either as
                long as you depend on the software or for as long as it takes you to
                get that patch into the upstream codebase.</p>

            <p>Even with the preferred way, the contract itself cannot require
                that the patch be accepted by the upstream project, because that would
                involve selling something that's not for sale. (What if the rest of
                the project unexpectedly decides not to support the feature?)
                However, the contract can require a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">bona
                    fide</em></span> effort to get the change accepted by the
                community, and that it be committed to the repository if the community
                agrees with it. For example, if the project has written standards
                (e.g., about coding conventions, documentation, writing regression
                tests, submitting patches, etc), the contract can reference those
                standards and specify that the contracted work must meet them. In
                practice, this usually works out the way everyone hopes.</p>

            <p>The best tactic for successful contracting is to hire one of the
                project's developersâpreferably a committerâas the
                contractor. This may seem like a form of purchasing influence, and,
                well, it is. But it's not as corrupt as it might seem. A developer's
                influence in the project is due mainly to the quality of her code and
                to her interactions with other developers. The fact that she has a
                contract to get certain things done doesn't raise her status in any
                way, and doesn't lower it either, though it may make people scrutinize
                her more carefully. Most developers would not risk their long-term
                position in the project by backing an inappropriate or widely disliked
                new feature. In fact, part of what you get, or should get, when you
                hire such a contractor is advice about what sorts of changes are
                likely to be accepted by the community. You also get a slight shift
                in the project's priorities. Because prioritization is just a matter
                of who has time to work on what, when you pay for someone's time, you
                cause their work to move up in the priority queue a bit. This is a
                well-understood fact of life among experienced open source developers,
                and at least some of them will devote attention to the contractor's
                work simply because it looks like it's going to <span class="emphasis"><em>get
                    done</em></span>, so they want to help it get done right. Perhaps they
                won't write any of the code, but they'll still discuss the design and
                review the code, both of which can be very useful. For all these
                reasons, the contractor is best drawn from the ranks of those already
                involved with the project.</p>

            <p>This immediately raises two questions: Should contracts ever be
                private? And when they're not, should you worry about creating
                tensions in the community by the fact that you've contracted with some
                developers and not others?</p>

            <p>It's best to be open about contracts when you can. Otherwise,
                the contractor's behavior may seem strange to others in the
                communityâperhaps she's suddenly giving inexplicably high
                priority to features she's never shown interest in the past. When
                people ask her why she wants them now, how can she answer convincingly
                if she can't talk about the fact that she's been contracted to write
                them?</p>

            <p>At the same time, neither you nor the contractor should act as
                though others should treat your arrangement as a big deal. Too often
                I've seen contractors waltz onto a development list with the attitude
                that their posts should be taken more seriously simply because they're
                being paid. That kind of attitude signals to the rest of the project
                that the contractor regards the fact of the contractâas opposed
                to the code <span class="emphasis"><em>resulting</em></span> from the contractâto
                be the important thing. But from the other developers' point of view,
                only the code matters. At all times, the focus of attention should be
                kept on technical issues, not on the details of who is paying whom.
                For example, one of the developers in the Subversion community handles
                contracting in a particularly graceful way. While discussing his code
                changes in IRC, he'll mention as an aside (often in a private remark,
                an IRC <em class="firstterm">privmsg</em>, to one of the other committers)
                that he's being paid for his work on this particular bug or feature.
                But he also consistently gives the impression that he'd want to be
                working on that change anyway, and that he's happy the money is making
                it possible for him to do that. He may or may not reveal his
                customer's identity, but in any case he doesn't dwell on the contract.
                His remarks about it are just an ornament to an otherwise technical
                discussion about how to get something done.</p>

            <p>That example shows another reason why it's good to be open about
                contracts. There may be multiple organizations sponsoring contracts
                on a given open source project, and if each knows what the others are
                trying to do, they may be able to pool their resources. In the above
                case, the project's largest funder (CollabNet) was not involved with
                these piecework contracts, but knowing that someone else was
                sponsoring certain bug fixes allowed CollabNet to redirect its
                resources to other bugs, resulting in greater efficiency for the
                project as a whole.</p>

            <p>Will other developers resent that some are paid for working on
                the project? In general, no, particularly when those who are paid are
                established, well-respected members of the community anyway. No one
                expects contract work to be distributed equally among all the
                committers. People understand the importance of long-term
                relationships: the uncertainties involved in contracting are such that
                once you find someone you can work reliably with, you would be
                reluctant to switch to a different person just for the sake of
                evenhandedness. Think of it this way: the first time you hire, there
                will be no complaints, because clearly you had to pick
                <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span>âit's not your fault you can't hire
                everyone. Later, when you hire the same person a second time, that's
                just common sense: you already know her, the last time was
                successful, so why take unnecessary risks? Thus, it's perfectly
                natural to have a few go-to people in the community, instead of
                spreading the work around evenly.</p>

                <p>The project's community will always be important to the
                    long-term success of contract work. Their involvement in the design
                    and review process for sizeable changes cannot be an afterthought; It
                    must be considered part of the work, and fully embraced by the
                    contractor. Don't think of community scrutiny as an obstacle to be
                    overcomeâthink of it as a free design board and QA department.
                    It is a benefit to be aggressively pursued, not merely endured.</p>

                    <p>In 1995, I was one half of a partnership that provided support
                        and enhancements for CVS (the Concurrent Versions System; see <a class="ulink"
                                                                                         href="http://nongnu.org/cvs"
                                                                                         target="_top">nongnu.org/cvs</a>).
                        My partner Jim
                        Blandy and I were, informally, the maintainers of CVS by that point. But
                        we'd never thought carefully about how we ought to relate to the
                        existing mostly part-time and volunteer CVS development community. We
                        just assumed that they'd send in patches, and we'd apply them, and
                        that was pretty much how it worked.</p>

                    <p>Back then, networked CVS could be done only over a remote login
                        program such as <code class="literal">rsh</code>. Using the same password for
                        CVS access as for login access was an obvious security risk, and many
                        organizations were put off by it. A major investment bank hired us to
                        add a new authentication mechanism, so they could safely use networked
                        CVS with their remote offices.</p>

                    <p>Jim and I took the contract and sat down to design the new
                        authentication system. What we came up with was pretty simple (the
                        United States had export controls on cryptographic code at the time,
                        so the customer understood that we couldn't implement strong
                        authentication), but as we were not experienced in designing such
                        protocols, we still made a few gaffes that would have been obvious to
                        an expert. These mistakes would easily have been caught had we taken
                        the time to write up a proposal and run it by the other developers for
                        review. But we never did so, because it didn't occur to us to think
                        of the development list as a resource to be used to improve our
                        contracted work. We knew that people
                        were probably going to accept whatever we committed, andâbecause
                        we didn't know what we didn't knowâwe didn't bother to do the
                        work in a visible way, e.g., posting patches frequently, making small,
                        easily digestible commits to a special branch, etc. The resulting
                        authentication protocol was not very good, and of course, once it
                        became established, it was difficult to improve, because of
                        compatibility concerns.</p>

                    <p>The root of the problem was not lack of experience; we could
                        easily have learned what we needed to know. The problem was our
                        attitude toward the volunteer development community. We regarded
                        acceptance of the changes as a hurdle to leap, rather than as a
                        process by which the quality of the changes could be improved. Since
                        we were confident that almost anything we did would be accepted (as it
                        was), we made little effort to get others involved.</p></div>
                <p>Obviously, when you're choosing a contractor, you want someone
                    with the right technical skills and experience for the job. But it's
                    also important to choose someone with a track record of constructive
                    interaction with the other developers in the community. That way
                    you're getting more than just a single person; you're getting an agent
                    who will be able to draw on a network of expertise to make sure the
                    work is done in a robust and maintainable way.</p></div>

            <p>Programming is only part of the work that goes on in an open
                source project. From the point of view of the project's volunteers,
                it's the most visible and glamorous part. This unfortunately means
                that other activities, such as documentation, formal testing, etc., can
                sometimes be neglected, at least compared to the amount of attention
                they often receive in proprietary software. Corporate organizations
                are sometimes able to make up for this, by devoting some of their
                internal software development infrastructure to open source
                projects.</p>

            <p>The key to doing this successfully is to translate between the
                company's internal processes and those of the public development
                community. Such translation is not effortless: often the two are not
                a close match, and the differences can only be bridged via human
                intervention. For example, the company may use a different bug
                tracker than the public project. Even if they use the same tracking
                software, the data stored in it will be very different, because the
                bug-tracking needs of a company are very different from those of a
                free software community. A piece of information that starts in one
                tracker may need to be reflected in the other, with confidential

                such bridges. The end result should be that the open source project
                runs more smoothly, the community recognizes the company's investment
                of resources, and yet does not feel that the company is
                inappropriately steering things toward its own goals.</p>

                <p>In proprietary software development, it is normal to have teams
                    of people dedicated solely to quality assurance: bug hunting,
                    performance and scalability testing, interface and documentation
                    checking, etc. As a rule, these activities are not pursued as
                    vigorously by the volunteer community on a free software project.
                    This is partly because it's hard to get volunteer labor for
                    unglamorous work like testing, partly because people tend to assume
                    that having a large user community gives the project good testing
                    coverage, and, in the case of performance and scalability testing,
                    partly because volunteers often don't have access to the necessary
                    hardware resources anyway.</p>

                <p>The assumption that having many users is equivalent to having
                    many testers is not entirely baseless. Certainly there's little point
                    assigning testers for basic functionality in common environments: bugs
                    there will quickly be found by users in the natural course of things.
                    But because users are just trying to get work done, they do not
                    consciously set out to explore uncharted edge cases in the program's
                    functionality, and are likely to leave certain classes of bugs
                    unfound. Furthermore, when they discover a bug with an easy
                    workaround, they often silently implement the workaround without
                    bothering to report the bug. Most insidiously, the usage patterns of
                    your customers (the people who drive <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
                    interest in the software) may differ in statistically significant ways
                    from the usage patterns of the Average User In The Street.</p>

                <p>A professional testing team can uncover these sorts of bugs, and
                    can do so as easily with free software as with proprietary software.
                    The challenge is to convey the testing team's results back to the
                    public in a useful form. In-house testing departments usually have
                    their own way of reporting test results to their own developers,
                    involving company-specific
                    jargon, or specialized knowledge about particular customers and their
                    data sets. Such reports would be inappropriate for the public bug
                    tracker, both because of their form and because of confidentiality
                    concerns. Even if your company's internal bug tracking software
                    were the same as that used by the public project, management might
                    need to make company-specific comments and metadata changes to the
                    tickets (for example, to raise an ticket's internal priority, or
                    schedule its resolution for a particular customer). Usually such
                    notes are confidentialâsometimes they're not even shown to the
                    customer. But even when they're not confidential, they're not very
                    helpful to the public project.</p>

                <p>Yet the core bug report itself <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important
                    to the public. In fact, a bug report from your testing department is
                    in some ways more valuable than one received from users at large,
                    since the testing department probes for things that other users won't.
                    Given that you're unlikely to get that particular bug report from any
                    other source, you definitely want to preserve it and make it
                    available to the public project.</p>

                <p>To do this, either the QA department can file tickets directly in
                    the public ticket tracker, if they're comfortable with that, or an
                    intermediary (usually one of the developers) can "translate" the
                    testing department's internal reports into new tickets in the public
                    tracker. Translation simply means describing the bug in a way that
                    makes no reference to customer-specific information (the reproduction
                    recipe may use customer data, assuming the customer approves it, of
                    course).</p>

                <p>It is definitely preferable to have the QA department filing
                    tickets in the public tracker directly. That gives the public a more
                    direct appreciation of your company's involvement with the project:
                    useful bug reports add to your organization's credibility just as any
                    technical contribution would. It also gives developers a direct line
                    of communication to the testing team. For example, if the internal QA
                    team is monitoring the public ticket tracker, a developer can commit a
                    fix for a scalability bug (which the developer may not have the
                    resources to test herself), and then add a note to the ticket asking
                    the QA team to see if the fix had the desired effect. Expect a bit of
                    resistance from some of the developers; programmers have a tendency to
                    regard QA as, at best, a necessary evil. The QA team can easily
                    overcome this by finding significant bugs and filing comprehensible
                    reports; on the other hand, if their reports are not at least as good
                    as those coming from the regular user community, then there's no point
                    having them interact directly with the development team.</p>

                <p>Either way, once a public ticket exists, the original internal
                    ticket should simply reference the public ticket for technical content.
                    Management and paid developers may continue to annotate the internal
                    ticket with company-specific comments as necessary, but use the public
                    ticket for information that should be available to everyone.</p>

                <p>You should go into this process expecting extra overhead.
                    Maintaining two tickets for one bug is, naturally, more work than
                    maintaining one ticket. The benefit is that many more coders will see
                    the report and be able to contribute to a solution.</p></div>

                <p>Corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, are almost the only
                    entities that ever pay attention to complex legal issues in free
                    software. Individual developers often understand the nuances of
                    various open source licenses, but they generally do not have the time
                    or resources to competently handle legal issues themselves. If your
                    company has a legal department, it can help a project by assisting
                    with trademark issues, copyright license ownership and compatibility
                    questions, defense against patent trolls, etc. If the project decides
                    to organize formally, or to join an existing umbrella organization,
                    your legal department can help with issues of corporate law, asset
                    transfer, reviewing agreements, and other due diligence
                    matters.</p>

                <p>Some more concrete ideas of what sorts of legal help might be
                    useful are discussed in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
                                               title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10,
                        <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a>. The main thing is to
                    make sure that communications between the legal department and the
                    development community, if they happen at all, happen with a mutual
                    appreciation of the very different universes the parties are coming
                    from. On occasion, these two groups talk past each other, each side
                    assuming domain-specific knowledge that the other does not have. A
                    good strategy is to have a liaison (usually a developer, or else a
                    lawyer with technical expertise) stand in the middle and translate for
                    as long as needed.</p></div>

                </div>
                <a name="subsidize-documentation-usability"></a>

                <p>Documentation and usability are both famous weak spots in open
                    source projects, although I think, at least in the case of
                    documentation, that the difference between free and proprietary
                    software is frequently exaggerated. Nevertheless, it is empirically
                    true that much open source software lacks first-class documentation
                    and usability research.</p>

                <p>If your organization wants to help fill these gaps for a
                    project, probably the best thing it can do is hire people who
                    are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> regular developers on the project, but
                    who will be able to interact productively with the developers.
                    Not hiring regular developers is good for two reasons: one, that way
                    you don't take development time away from the project; two, those
                    closest to the software are usually the wrong people to write
                    documentation or investigate usability anyway, because they have
                    trouble seeing the software from an outsider's point of view.</p>

                <p>However, it will still be necessary for whoever works on these
                    problems to communicate with the developers. Find people who are
                    technical enough to talk to the coding team, but not so expert in the
                    software that they can't empathize with regular users anymore.</p>

                <p>A medium-level user is probably the right person to write good
                    documentation. In fact, after the first edition of this book was
                    published, I received the following email from an open source
                    developer named Dirk Reiners:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>One comment on Money::Documentation and Usability: when we had
                        some
                        money to spend and decided that a beginner's tutorial was the most
                        critical piece that we needed we hired a medium-level user to write it.
                        He had gone through the induction to the system recently enough to
                        remember the problems, but he had gotten past them so he knew how to
                        describe them. That allowed him to write something that needed only
                        minor fixes by the core developers for the things that he hadn't gotten
                        right, but still covering the 'obvious' stuff devs would have missed.</p>

                        <p>His case was even better, as it had been his job to introduce a bunch of
                            other people (students) to the system, so he combined the experience of
                            many people, which is something that was just a lucky occurrence and is
                            probably hard to get in most cases.</p></blockquote>

                    <p>The field of user experience (<em class="firstterm">UX</em>) design
                        has lately (as of this writing in early 2014) begun to acquire a new
                        seriousness of purpose and consistency of professional standards.
                        Naturally, one thing many companies think of when they want to help
                        improve an open source project is to fund UX work, since that's just
                        the sort of thing that projects often overlook or, in some cases,
                        don't even know they need.</p>

                    <p>As with many other types of engagement, do not assume that a UX
                        expert can be parachuted into the project. User experience design is
                        not a checkbox. It is an attitude taken by a team throughout
                        development, and one of the primary qualifications to look for in UX
                        contractors is their ability to gain long-term credibility with the
                        developers, and to help developers pay attention to user experience
                        goals. For example, in addition to their innate domain knowledge, UX
                        designers often know how to set up and incorporate feedback from user
                        trials&nbsp;â&nbsp;but those trials will only be effective if
                        the results are presented to the development team in a way that makes
                        it easy for the developers to take the results seriously. This can
                        only happen through a sustained, two-way interaction, in which UX
                        experts are subscribed to the appropriate project forums and take the
                        attitude that they are a kind of specialized developer on the project,
                        rather than an outside expert providing advice. Use UX experts who
                        have worked with open source projects before, if possible.</p></div>

                    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) for open source
                    projects has meant that it is increasingly unnecessary for projects to
                    get corporate support for basic project-hosting infrastructure. It
                    still happens sometimes, usually in cases where the company itself
                    started the project, and is trying to create or keep an association in
                    the public's mind between the project and the company. The most
                    common technique for creating this association is for the company to
                    host the project's resources under the company's domain name, thus
                    getting association through the project's URLs.</p>

                <p>While this will cause most users to think of the software as
                    having <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> to do with your company, it can
                    also cause a problem: developers are aware of this associative
                    tendency too, and may not be very comfortable with having the project
                    hosted under your domain unless you're seriously contributing to the
                    projectânot just bandwidth and server space, but significant
                    amounts of development time. After all, there are a lot of free
                    places to host these days. The community may eventually feel that the
                    implied misallocation of credit is not worth the minor convenience
                    brought by donated hosting, and may even attempt to take the project
                    elsewhere. So if you want to provide hosting, do soâbut if you
                    are actually trying to create a public association between your
                    company and the project, make sure that the level of support you
                    provide is matched to the amount of credit you claim, whether you
                    claim it via URL, banner ads, or some other means.</p></div>

                <p>Many projects have infrastructure needs beyond just hosting of
                    code, bug tracker, etc. For example, projects often use
                    <em class="firstterm">continuous integration</em> (CI) testing
                    (a.k.a. <em class="firstterm">build farms</em>) to automatically ensure
                    that the changes developers are committing both integrate into the
                    mainline trunk and pass all regression tests<sup>[<a name="idp7546128" href="#ftn.idp7546128"
                                                                         class="footnote">45</a>]</sup>.
                    However, depending on the size and complexity of the codebase, the
                    number of developers checking in changes, and other factors, running a
                    responsive build farm can cost more money than any individual
                    developer has at their disposal. A good way to help, and gain some
                    goodwill in the process, is to donate the server space and bandwith
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the technical expertise to set up the

                    technical expertise available on staff, you could hire someone from
                    the project to do it, or at the very least give some of the project's
                    developers administrative access to the CI servers so they can set
                    things up themselves.</p></div>

            <p>Although most open source developers would probably hate to
                admit it, marketing works. Good marketing <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span>
                create buzz around an open source product, even to the point where
                hardheaded coders find themselves having vaguely positive thoughts
                about the software for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.
                It is not my purpose here to dissect the arms-race dynamics of marketing
                in general. Any corporation involved in free software will eventually
                find itself considering how to market themselves, the software, or
                their relationship to the software. The advice below is about how to
                avoid common pitfalls in such an effort; see also <a class="xref" href="#publicity" title="Publicity">the

                <p>For the sake of keeping the volunteer developer community on
                    your side, it is <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> important not to say
                    anything that isn't demonstrably true. Audit all claims carefully
                    before making them, and give the public the means to check your claims
                    on their own. Independent fact checking is a major part of open
                    source, and it applies to more than just the code.</p>

                <p>Naturally no one would advise companies to make unverifiable
                    claims anyway. But with open source activities, there is an unusually
                    high quantity of people with the expertise to verify
                    claimsâpeople who are also likely to have high-bandwidth
                    Internet access and the right social contacts to publicize their
                    findings in a damaging way, should they choose to. When Global
                    Megacorp Chemical Industries pollutes a stream, that's verifiable, but
                    only by trained scientists, who can then be refuted by Global
                    Megacorp's scientists, leaving the public scratching their heads and
                    wondering what to think. On the other hand, your behavior in the open
                    source world is not only visible and recorded, it is also easy for
                    many people to check it independently, come to their own conclusions,
                    and spread those conclusions by word of mouth. These communications
                    networks are already in place; they are the essence of how open source
                    operates, and they can be used to transmit any sort of information.
                    Refutation is usually difficult, if not impossibleâespecially
                    when what people are saying is true.</p>

                <p>For example, it's okay to refer to your organization as having
                    "founded project X" if you really did. But don't refer to yourself as
                    the "makers of X" if most of the code was written by outsiders.
                    Conversely, don't claim to have a deeply involved volunteer developer
                    community if anyone can look at your repository and see that there are
                    few or no code changes coming from outside your organization.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Once I saw an announcement by a very well-known computer
                        company, stating that they were releasing an important software
                        package under an open source license. When the initial announcement
                        came out, I took a look at their now-public version control repository
                        and saw that it contained only three revisions. In other words, they
                        had done an initial import of the source code, but hardly anything had
                        happened since then. That in itself was not worryingâthey'd
                        just made the announcement, after all. There was no reason to expect
                        a lot of development activity right away.</p>

                    <p>Some time later, they made another announcement. Here is what
                        it said, with the name and release number replaced by pseudonyms:</p>

                    <div class="blockquote">
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We are pleased to announce that
                            following
                            rigorous testing by the Singer Community, Singer&nbsp;5 for Linux
                            and Windows are now ready for production use.</em></span></p></blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>Curious to know what the community had uncovered in "rigorous
                        testing," I went back to the repository to look at its recent change
                        history. The project was still on revision 3. Apparently, they
                        hadn't found a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> bug worth fixing before the
                        release! Thinking that the results of the community testing must have
                        been recorded elsewhere, I next examined the bug tracker. There were
                        exactly six open tickets, four of which had been open for several months
                        already.</p>

                    <p>This beggars belief, of course. When testers pound on a large
                        and complex piece of software for any length of time, they will find
                        bugs. Even if the fixes for those bugs don't make it into the
                        upcoming release, one would still expect some version control activity
                        as a result of the testing process, or at least some new tickets. Yet
                        to all appearances, nothing had happened between the announcement of
                        the open source license and the first open source release.</p>

                    <p>The point is not that the company was lying about the "rigorous
                        testing" by the community (though I suspect they were). The point is
                        that they were oblivious to how much it <span class="emphasis"><em>looked</em></span> like
                        they were lying. Since neither the version control repository nor the
                        ticket tracker gave any indication that the alleged rigorous testing
                        had occurred, the company should either not have made the claim in the
                        first place, or should have provided a clear link to some tangible
                        result of that testing ("We found 278 bugs; click here for details").
                        The latter would have allowed anyone to get a handle on the level of
                        community activity very quickly. As it was, it only took me a few
                        minutes to determine that whatever this community testing was, it had
                        not left traces in any of the usual places. That's not a lot of
                        effort, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who took the trouble.</p>

                    <p>Transparency and verifiability are also an important part of
                        accurate crediting, of course. See

                <p>Refrain from giving negative opinions about competing open
                    source software. It's perfectly okay to give negative
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>facts</em></span>âthat is, easily confirmable
                    assertions of the sort often seen in good comparison charts. But
                    negative characterizations of a less rigorous nature are best avoided,
                    for two reasons. First, they are liable to start flame wars that
                    detract from productive discussion. Second, and more importantly,
                    some of the volunteer developers in <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> project
                    may turn out to work on the competing project as well. This is more
                    likely than it at first might seem: the projects are already in the
                    same domain (that's why they're in competition), and developers with
                    expertise in that domain may make contributions wherever their
                    expertise is applicable. Even when there is no direct developer
                    overlap, it is likely that developers on your project are at least
                    acquainted with developers on related projects. Their ability to
                    maintain constructive personal ties could be hampered by
                    overly negative marketing messages.</p>

                <p>Bashing competing closed-source products seems to be more widely
                    accepted in the open source world, especially when those products are
                    made by Microsoft. Personally, I deplore this tendency (though again,
                    there's nothing wrong with straightforward factual comparisons), not
                    merely because it's rude, but also because it's dangerous for a
                    project to start believing its own hype and thereby ignore the ways in
                    which the competition may actually be superior. In general, watch out
                    for the effect that marketing statements can have on your own
                    development community. People may be so excited at being backed by
                    marketing dollars that they lose objectivity about their software's
                    true strengths and weaknesses. It is normal, and even expected, for a
                    company's developers to exhibit a certain detachment toward marketing
                    statements, even in public forums. Clearly, they should not come out
                    and contradict the marketing message directly (unless it's actually
                    wrong, though one hopes that sort of thing would have been caught
                    earlier). But they may poke fun at it from time to time, as a way of
                    bringing the rest of the development community back down to
                    earth.</p></div>

                companies need to guarantee that certain features and bug fixes land
                in a specified amount of time, they accomplish this by keeping their
                own copy (which may be partially or wholly public) of the project, and
                merging it from time to time with a separate public copy that has its
                own governance. Google's Android operating system is a classic
                example: Google maintains its own copy of Android, which it governs
                pleases, and from time to time merges changes between that copy and
                the <a class="ulink"

                       target="_top">Android Open Source Project</a>. Essentially, Google is on a
                very long copy-modify-merge loop with respect to the open source
                project, or perhaps it's the other way around. In any case, it is in
                neither side's interests to permanently diverge from the
                other.</p></div>

                Wolf's <a class="ulink" href="http://snowdrift.coop/" target="_top">Snowdrift.coop</a> is a recent
                and interesting new approach to crowdfunding for libre projects.
                It focuses on sustainability beyond initial funding, by
                harnessing a limited positive feedback loop: pool donations are
                re-allocated, up to per-donor limits, depending on which projects
                people indicate support for. It's still in its early stages, so
                it's too early to tell if it will fly, but I thought it deserved
                a footnote. Check it out; by the time these words are published,
                Snowdrift might be out of alpha.</p></div>

            <p>The ability to write clearly is perhaps the most important skill
                one can have in an open source environment. In the long run it
                matters more than programming talent. A great programmer with lousy
                communications skills can get only one thing done at a time, and even
                then may have trouble convincing others to pay attention. But a lousy
                programmer with good communications skills can coordinate and persuade
                many people to do many different things, and thereby have a
                significant effect on a project's direction and momentum.</p>

            <p>There does not seem to be much correlation, in either direction,
                between the ability to write good code and the ability to communicate
                with one's fellow human beings. There is some correlation between
                programming well and describing technical issues well, but describing
                technical issues is only a tiny part of the communications in a
                project. Much more important is the ability to empathize with one's
                audience, to see one's own posts and comments as others see them, and
                to cause others to see their own posts with similar objectivity.
                Equally important is noticing when a given medium or communications
                method is no longer working well, perhaps because it doesn't scale as
                the number of users increases, and taking the time to do something
                about it.</p>

            <p>All of which is obvious in theoryâwhat makes it hard in
                practice is that free software development environments are
                bewilderingly diverse both in audiences and in communications
                mechanisms. Should a given thought be expressed in a post to the
                mailing list, as an annotation in the bug tracker, or as a comment
                in the code? When answering a question in a public forum, how much
                knowledge can you assume on the part of the reader, given that "the
                reader" is not only the one who asked the question in the first place,
                but all those who might see your response? How can the developers
                stay in constructive contact with the users, without getting swamped
                by feature requests, spurious bug reports, and general chatter? How
                do you tell when a medium has reached the limits of its capacity, and
                what do you do about it?</p>

            <p>Solutions to these problems are usually partial, because any
                particular solution is eventually made obsolete by project growth or
                changes in project structure. They are also often <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
                    hoc</em></span>, because they're improvised responses to dynamic
                situations. All participants need to be aware of when and how
                communications can become bogged down, and be involved in
                solutions. Helping people do this is a big part of managing an open
                source project. The sections that follow discuss both how to conduct
                your own communications, and how to make maintenance of communications
                mechanisms a priority for everyone in the project.<sup>[<a name="idp7797312" href="#ftn.idp7797312"

                if your emails are rambling and unstructured, people will assume

                unstructured in person, but no one need ever know it, if your posts
                are lucid and informative.</p>

            <p>Devoting some care to your writing will pay off hugely.
                Long-time free software hacker Jim Blandy tells the following
                story:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Back in 1993, I was working for the Free Software Foundation,
                    and we were beta-testing version 19 of GNU Emacs. We'd make a beta
                    release every week or so, and people would try it out and send us
                    bug reports. There was this one guy whom none of us had met in
                    person but who did great work: his bug reports were always clear and
                    led us straight to the problem, and when he provided a fix himself,
                    it was almost always right. He was top-notch.</p>

                    <p>Now, before the FSF can use code written by someone else, we
                        have them do some legal paperwork to assign their copyright interest
                        to that code to the FSF. Just taking code from complete strangers
                        and dropping it in is a recipe for legal disaster.</p>

                    <p>So I emailed the guy the forms, saying, "Here's some paperwork
                        we need, here's what it means, you sign this one, have your employer
                        sign that one, and then we can start putting in your fixes. Thanks
                        very much."</p>

                    <p>He sent me back a message saying, "I don't have an
                        employer."</p>

                    <p>So I said, "Okay, that's fine, just have your university sign
                        it and send it back."</p>

                    <p>After a bit, he wrote me back again, and said, "Well,
                        actually... I'm thirteen years old and I live with my
                        parents."</p></blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>Because that kid didn't write like a thirteen-year-old, no one
                knew that's what he was. Following are some ways to make your writing
                give a good impression too.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Structure and Formatting">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="structure-and-formatting"></a>Structure and Formatting</h3>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Don't fall into the trap of writing everything as though it were
                    a cell phone text message. Write in complete sentences, capitalizing
                    the first word of each sentence, and use paragraph breaks where
                    needed. This is most important in emails and other composed writings.
                    In IRC or similarly ephemeral forums, it's generally okay to leave out
                    capitalization, use compressed forms of common expressions, etc. Just
                    don't carry those habits over into more formal, persistent forums.
                    Emails, documentation, bug reports, and other pieces of writing that
                    are intended to have a permanent life should be written using standard
                    grammar and spelling, and have a coherent narrative structure. This
                    is not because there's anything inherently good about following
                    arbitrary rules, but rather that these rules are
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> arbitrary: they evolved into their present
                    forms because they make text more readable, and you should adhere to
                    them for that reason. Readability is desirable not only because it
                    means more people will understand what you write, but because it makes
                    you look like the sort of person who takes the time to communicate
                    clearly: that is, someone worth paying attention to.</p>

                <p>For email in particular, experienced open source developers have
                    settled on certain conventions:</p>

                <p>Send plain text mails only, not HTML, RichText, or other formats
                    that might get mangled by certain online archives or text-based mail
                    readers. When including screen output, snippets of code, or other
                    preformatted text, offset it clearly, so that even a lazy eye can
                    easily see the boundaries between your prose and the material you're
                    quoting. If the overall structure of your post is still visible from
                    five meters away, you're doing it right. Also, try to keep such
                    preformatted blocks under 72 columns wide, and don't exceed 80
                    columns, which has become the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de
                        facto</em></span>
                    standard terminal width (that is, some people may use wider displays,
                    but no one uses a narrower one). By making your lines a little
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> than 80 columns, you leave room for a few
                    levels of quoting characters to be added in others' replies without
                    forcing a rewrapping of your text.</p>

                <p><a name="quoting-and-top-posting"></a>When quoting someone else's mail,
                    insert your responses where they're most appropriate, at several
                    different places if necessary, and trim off the parts of their mail
                    you didn't use. If you're writing a quick response that applies to
                    their entire post, and your response will be sensible even to someone
                    who hasn't read the original, then it's okay to
                    <em class="firstterm">top-post</em> (that is, to put your response above
                    the quoted text of their mail); otherwise, quote the relevant portion
                    of the original text first, followed by your response.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Construct the subject lines of new mails
                    carefully.</em></span> It's the most important line in your mail,
                    because it allows each other person in the project to decide whether
                    or not to read more. Modern mail reading software organizes groups of
                    related messages into threads, which can be defined not only by a
                    common subject, but by various other headers (which are sometimes not
                    displayed). It follows that if a thread starts to drift to a new
                    topic, you canâand shouldâadjust the subject line
                    accordingly when replying. The thread's integrity will be preserved,
                    due to those other headers, but the new subject will help people
                    looking at an overview of the thread know that the topic has drifted.
                    Likewise, if you really want to start a new topic, do it by posting a
                    fresh mail, not by replying to an existing mail and changing the
                    subject. Otherwise, your mail would still be grouped in to the same
                    thread as what you're replying to, and thus fool people into thinking
                    it's about something it's not. Again, the penalty would not only be
                    the waste of their time, but the slight dent in your credibility as
                    someone fluent in using communications tools.</p></div>

                    are some principles that make it more likely.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Make things easy for your readers.</em></span>
                    There's a ton of information
                    floating around in any active open source project, and readers cannot
                    be expected to be familiar with most of itâindeed, they cannot
                    always be expected to know how to become familiar. Wherever possible,
                    your posts should provide information in the form most convenient for
                    readers. If you have to spend an extra two minutes to dig up the URL
                    to a particular thread in the mailing list archives, in order to save
                    your readers the trouble of doing so, it's worth it. If you have to
                    spend an extra 5 or 10 minutes summarizing the conclusions so far
                    of a complex thread, in order to give people context in which to
                    understand your post, then do so. Think of it this way: the more
                    successful a project, the higher the reader-to-writer ratio in any
                    given forum. If every post you make is seen by <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>
                    people, then as <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> rises, the worthwhileness of
                    expending extra effort to save those people time rises with it. And
                    as people see you imposing this standard on yourself, they will work
                    to match it in their own communications. The result is, ideally, an
                    increase in the global efficiency of the project: when there is a
                    choice between <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> people making an effort and one
                    person doing so, the project prefers the latter.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Don't engage in hyperbole.</em></span>
                    Exaggerating in online posts is a
                    classic arms race. For example, a person reporting a bug may worry
                    that the developers will not pay sufficient attention, so he'll
                    describe it as a severe, showstopper problem that is preventing him
                    (and all his friends/coworkers/cousins) from using the software
                    productively, when it's actually only a mild annoyance. But
                    exaggeration is not limited to usersâprogrammers often do the
                    same thing during technical debates, particularly when the
                    disagreement is over a matter of taste rather than correctness:</p>

                </div>
                <p>The same sentiment actually becomes

                </div>
                <p>You will not be able to rid the project of hyperbole completely, and in
                    general it's not necessary to do so. Compared to other forms of
                    miscommunication, hyperbole is not globally damagingâit hurts
                    mainly the perpetrator. The recipients can compensate, it's just that
                    the sender loses a little more credibility each time. Therefore, for
                    the sake of your own influence in the project, try to err on the side
                    of moderation. That way, when you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> need to
                    make a strong point, people will take you seriously.</p>

                <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Edit twice.</em></span>
                    For any message longer than a medium-sized
                    paragraph, reread it from top to bottom before sending it but after
                    you think it's done the first time. This is familiar advice to anyone
                    who's taken a composition class, but it's especially important in
                    online discussion. Because the process of online composition tends to
                    be highly discontinuous (in the course of writing a message, you may
                    need to go back and check other mails, visit certain web pages, run a
                    command to capture its debugging output, etc.), it's especially easy to
                    lose your sense of narrative place. Messages that were composed
                    discontinuously and not checked before being sent are often
                    recognizable as such, much to the chagrin (or so one would hope) of
                    their authors. Take the time to review what you send. The more your
                    posts hold together structurally, the more they will be read by others.</p></div>

                <p>After writing thousands of messages, you will probably find your
                    style tending toward the terse. This seems to be the norm in most
                    technical forums, and there's nothing wrong with it per se. A degree
                    of terseness that would be unacceptable in normal social interactions
                    is simply the default for free software hackers. Here's a response I
                    once drew on a mailing list about some free content management
                    software, quoted in full:</p><pre class="screen">Can you possibly elaborate a bit more on exactly what problems
you ran into, etc?

Also:

What version of Slash are you using? I couldn't tell from your
original message.

Did you try the Apache 2.0 patch that was posted about on
slashcode.com?

</pre>
                <p>Now <span class="emphasis"><em>that's</em></span> terse! No greeting, no sign-off
                    other than his name, and the message itself is just a series of
                    questions phrased as compactly as possible. His one declarative
                    sentence was an implicit criticism of my original message. And yet, I
                    was happy to see Shane's mail, and didn't take his terseness as a sign
                    of anything other than him being a busy person. The mere fact that he
                    was asking questions, instead of ignoring my post, meant that he was
                    willing to spend some time on my problem.</p>

                <p>Will all readers react positively to this style? Not
                    necessarily; it depends on the person and the context. For example,
                    if someone has just posted acknowledging that he made a mistake
                    (perhaps he wrote a bug), and you know from past experience that
                    this person tends to be a bit insecure, then while you may still write
                    a compact response, you should make sure to leaven it with some sort
                    of acknowledgment of his feelings. The bulk of your response might
                    be a brief, engineer's-eye analysis of the situation, as terse as you
                    want. But at the end, sign off with something indicating that your
                    terseness is not to be taken as coldness. For example, if you've just
                    given reams of advice about exactly how the person should fix the bug,
                    then sign off with "Good luck, &lt;your name here&gt;" to indicate
                    that you wish him well and are not mad. A strategically placed
                    smiley face or other emoticlue can often be enough to reassure an
                    interlocutor, too.</p>

                <p>It may seem odd to focus as much on the participant's feelings
                    as on the surface of what they say, but, to put it baldly, feelings
                    affect productivity. Feelings are important for other reasons too,
                    but even confining ourselves to purely utilitarian grounds, we may
                    note that unhappy people write worse software and tackle fewer bugs. Given
                    the restricted nature of most electronic media, though, there will
                    often be no overt clue about how a person is feeling. You will have
                    to make an educated guess based on a) how most people would feel in
                    that situation, and b) what you know of this particular person from
                    past interactions. Some people prefer a more hands-off attitude, and
                    simply deal with everyone at face value, the idea being that if a
                    participant doesn't say outright that he feels a particular way, then
                    one has no business treating him as though he does. I don't buy this
                    approach, for a couple of reasons. One, people don't behave that way
                    in real life, so why would they online? Two, since most interactions
                    take place in public forums, people tend to be even more restrained in
                    expressing emotions than they might be in private. To be more
                    precise, they are often willing to express emotions directed at
                    others, such as gratitude or outrage, but not emotions directed
                    inwardly, such as insecurity or pride. Yet most humans work better
                    when they know that others are aware of their state of mind. By
                    paying attention to small clues, you can usually guess right most of
                    the time, and motivate people to stay involved to a greater degree
                    than they otherwise might.</p>

                <p>I don't mean, of course, that your role is to be a group
                    therapist, constantly helping everyone to get in touch with their
                    feelings. But by paying careful attention to long-term patterns in
                    people's behavior, you will begin to get a sense of them as
                    individuals even if you never meet them face-to-face. And by being
                    sensitive to the tone of your own writing, you can have a surprising
                    amount of influence over how others feel, to the ultimate benefit of
                    the project.</p></div>

                <p>One of the defining characteristics of open source culture is
                    its distinctive notions of what does and does not constitute rudeness.
                    While the conventions described below are not unique to free software
                    development, nor even to software in generalâthey would be
                    familiar to anyone working in mathematics, the hard sciences, or
                    engineering disciplinesâfree software, with its porous
                    boundaries and constant influx of newcomers, is an environment where
                    these conventions are especially likely to be encountered by people
                    unfamiliar with them.</p>

                <p>Let's start with the things that are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
                    rude:</p>

                <p>Technical criticism, even when direct and unpadded, is not rude.
                    Indeed, it can be a form of flattery: the critic is saying, by
                    implication, that the target is worth taking seriously, and is worth
                    spending some time on. That is, the more viable it would have been to
                    simply ignore someone's post, the more of a compliment it becomes to
                    take the time to criticize it (unless the critique descends into an
                    <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad hominem</em></span> attack or some other
                    form of
                    obvious rudeness, of course).</p>

                <p>Blunt, unadorned questions, such as Shane's questions to me in
                    the previously quoted email, are not rude either. Questions that in
                    other contexts might seem cold, rhetorical, or even mocking, are often
                    intended seriously, and have no hidden agenda other than eliciting
                    information as quickly as possible. The famous technical support
                    question "Is your computer plugged in?" is a classic example of this.
                    The support person really does need to know if your computer is
                    plugged in, and after the first few days on the job, has gotten tired
                    of prefixing her question with polite blandishments ("I beg your
                    pardon, I just want to ask a few simple questions to rule out some
                    possibilities. Some of these might seem pretty basic, but bear with
                    me..."). At this point, she doesn't bother with the padding anymore,
                    she just asks straight out: is it plugged in or not? Equivalent
                    questions are asked all the time on free software mailing lists. The
                    intent is not to insult the recipient, but to quickly rule out the
                    most obvious (and perhaps most common) explanations. Recipients who
                    understand this and react accordingly win points for taking a
                    broad-minded view without prompting. But recipients who react badly
                    must not be reprimanded, either. It's just a collision of cultures,
                    not anyone's fault. Explain amiably that your question (or criticism)
                    had no hidden meanings; it was just meant to get (or transmit)
                    information as efficiently as possible, nothing more.</p>

                <p>So what <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> rude?</p>

                <p>By the same principle under which detailed technical criticism
                    is a form of flattery, failure to provide quality criticism can be a
                    kind of insult. I don't mean simply ignoring someone's work, be it a
                    proposal, code change, new ticket filing, or whatever. Unless you
                    explicitly promised a detailed reaction in advance, it's usually okay
                    to simply not react at all. People will assume you just didn't have
                    time to say anything. But if you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> react, don't
                    skimp: take the time to really analyze things, provide concrete
                    examples where appropriate, dig around in the archives to find related
                    posts from the past, etc. Or if you don't have time to put in that
                    kind of effort, but still need to write some sort of brief response,
                    then state the shortcoming openly in your message ("I think there's a
                    ticket filed for this, but unfortunately didn't have time to search for
                    it, sorry"). The main thing is to recognize the existence of the
                    cultural norm, either by fulfilling it or by openly acknowledging
                    that one has fallen short this time. Either way, the norm is
                    strengthened. But failing to meet that norm, while at the same time
                    not explaining <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you failed to meet it, is like
                    saying the topic (and those participating in it) was not worth much
                    of your timeâthat your time is more valuable than theirs.
                    Better to show that your time is valuable by being terse than by being
                    lazy.</p>

                <p>There are many other forms of rudeness, of course, but most of
                    them are not specific to free software development, and common sense
                    is a good enough guide to avoid them. See also

            <div class="sect2" title="Face">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="face"></a>Face</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>There is a region in the human brain devoted specifically to
                    recognizing faces. It is known informally as the "fusiform face
                    area" and apparently its capabilities are at least partly inborn, not
                    learned. It turns out that recognizing individual people is such a
                    crucial survival skill that we have evolved specialized hardware to do
                    it.</p>

                <p>Internet-based collaboration is therefore psychologically odd,
                    because it involves tight cooperation between human beings who almost
                    never get to identify each other by the most natural, intuitive
                    methods: facial recognition first of all, but also sound of voice,
                    posture, etc. To compensate for this, try to use a consistent
                    <em class="firstterm">screen name</em> everywhere. It should be the front
                    part of your email address (the part before the @-sign), your IRC
                    username, your repository committer name, your ticket tracker username,
                    and so on. This name is your online "face": a short identifying
                    string that serves some of the same purpose as your real face,
                    although it does not, unfortunately, stimulate the same built-in
                    hardware in the brain.</p>

                <p>The screen name should be some intuitive permutation of your
                    real name (mine, for example, is "kfogel"). In some situations it
                    will be accompanied by your full name anyway, for example in mail
                    headers:</p><pre class="screen">From: "Karl Fogel" &lt;kfogel@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre>
                <p>Actually, there are two things going on in that example. As
                    mentioned earlier, the screen name matches the real name in an
                    intuitive way. But also, the real name is <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span>.
                    That is, it's not some made-up appellation like:</p><pre class="screen">From: "Wonder Hacker" &lt;wonderhacker@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre>
                <p>There's a famous cartoon by Paul Steiner, from the July 5, 1993
                    issue of <em class="citetitle">The New Yorker</em>, that shows one dog
                    logged into a computer terminal, looking down and telling another
                    conspiratorially: "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog." This
                    kind of thought probably lies behind a lot of the self-aggrandizing,
                    meant-to-be-hip online identities people give themselvesâas if
                    calling oneself "Wonder Hacker" will actually cause people to believe
                    one <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a wonderful hacker. But the fact remains:
                    even if no one knows you're a dog, you're still a dog. A fantastical
                    online identity never impresses readers. Instead, it makes them think
                    you're more into image than substance, or that you're simply insecure.
                    Use your real name for all interactions, or if for some reason you
                    require anonymity, then make up a name that sounds like a perfectly
                    normal real name, and use it consistently.</p>

                <p>In addition to keeping your online face consistent, there are
                    some things you can do to make it more attractive. If you have an
                    official title (e.g., "doctor", "professor", "director"), don't flaunt
                    it, nor even mention it except when it's directly relevant to the
                    conversation. Hackerdom in general, and free software culture in
                    particular, tends to view title displays as exclusionary and a sign of
                    insecurity. It's okay if your title appears as part of a standard
                    signature block at the end of every mail you send, just don't ever use
                    it as a tool to bolster your position in a discussionâthe
                    attempt is guaranteed to backfire. You want folks to respect the
                    person, not the title.</p>

                <p>Speaking of signature blocks: keep them small and tasteful, or
                    better yet, nonexistent. Avoid large legal disclaimers tacked on to
                    the end of every mail, especially when they express sentiments
                    incompatible with participation in a free software project. For
                    example, the following classic of the genre appears at the end of
                    every post a particular user makes to a certain project mailing list:</p><pre class="screen">IMPORTANT NOTICE

                <p>For someone who's just showing up to ask a question now and
                    then, that huge disclaimer looks a bit silly but probably doesn't do
                    any lasting harm. However, if this person wanted to participate
                    actively in the project, that legal boilerplate would start to have a
                    more insidious effect. It would send at least two potentially
                    destructive signals: first, that this person doesn't have full control
                    over his toolsâhe's trapped inside some corporate mailer that
                    tacks an annoying message to the end of every email, and he hasn't got
                    any way to route around itâand second, that he has little or no
                    organizational support for his free software activities. True, the
                    organization has clearly not banned him outright from posting to
                    public lists, but it has made his posts look distinctly unwelcoming,
                    as though the risk of letting out confidential information must trump
                    all other priorities.</p>

                <p>If you work for an organization that insists on adding such
                    signature blocks to all outgoing mail, and you can't get the policy
                    changed, then consider using your personal email account to post, even
                    if you're being paid by your employer for your participation in the
                    project.</p></div>

                <p>A common pitfall in online project participation is to think
                    that you have to respond to everything. You don't. First of all,
                    there will usually be more threads going on than you can keep track
                    of, at least after the project really gets going. Second,
                    even in the threads that you have decided to engage in, much of what
                    people say will not require a response. Development forums in
                    particular tend to be dominated by three kinds of messages:</p>

                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Messages proposing something non-trivial</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Messages expressing support or opposition to
                            something someone else has said</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Summing-up messages</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>None of these <span class="emphasis"><em>inherently</em></span> requires a
                    response, particularly if you can be fairly sure, based on watching
                    the thread so far, that someone else is likely to say what you would
                    have said anyway. (If you're worried that you'll be caught in a
                    wait-wait loop because all the others are using this tactic too, don't
                    be; there's almost always <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> out there
                    who'll feel like jumping into the fray.) A response should be
                    motivated by a definite purpose. Ask yourself first: do you know what
                    you want to accomplish? And second: will it not get accomplished
                    unless you say something?</p>

                <p>Two good reasons to add your voice to a thread are a) when you
                    see a flaw in a proposal and suspect that you're the only one who sees
                    it, and b) when you see that miscommunication is happening between
                    others, and know that you can fix it with a clarifying post. It's
                    also generally fine to post just to thank someone for doing something,
                    or to say "Me too!", because a reader can tell right away that such
                    posts do not require any response or further action, and therefore the
                    mental effort demanded by the post ends cleanly when the reader
                    reaches the last line of the mail. But even then, think twice before
                    saying something; it's always better to leave people wishing you'd
                    post more than wishing you'd post less. (The second half of

                    about how to behave
                    on a busy mailing list.)</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Productive vs Unproductive Threads">

                <p>On a busy mailing list, you have two imperatives. One,
                    obviously, is to figure out what you need to pay attention to and what
                    you can ignore. The other is to behave in a way that
                    avoids <span class="emphasis"><em>causing</em></span> noise: not only do you want your
                    own posts to have a high signal/noise ratio, you also want them to be
                    the sorts of messages that stimulate <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> people
                    to either post with a similarly high signal/noise ratio, or not post
                    at all.</p>

                <p>To see how to do that, let's consider the context in which it is
                    done. What are some of the hallmarks of an unproductive thread?</p>

                <div class="itemizedlist">
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Arguments that have been made already start to be
                            repeated in the same thread, as though the poster thinks
                            no one heard them the first time.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Increasing levels of hyperbole and involvement as
                            the stakes get smaller and smaller.</p></li>

                            little or nothing, while the people who tend to get things
                            done are silent.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Many ideas discussed without clear proposals ever
                            being made. (Of course, any interesting idea starts out
                            as an imprecise vision; the important question is what
                            direction it goes from there. Does the thread seem to be
                            turning the vision into something more concrete, or is it
                            spinning off into sub-visions, side-visions, and
                            ontological disputes?)</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Just because a thread is not productive at first doesn't mean
                    it's a waste of time. It might be about an important topic, in which
                    case the fact that it's not making any headway is all the more
                    troublesome.</p>

                <p>Guiding a thread toward usefulness without being pushy is an
                    art. It won't work to simply admonish people to stop wasting their
                    time, or to ask them not to post unless they have something constructive
                    to say. You may, of course, think these things privately, but if you
                    say them out loud then you will be offensiveâand
                    ineffective. Instead, you have to
                    suggest conditions for further progress: give people a route, a
                    path to follow that leads to the results you want, yet without
                    sounding like you're dictating conduct. The distinction is largely
                    one of tone. For example, this is bad:</p>

                        these proposals? There's no reason to keep going around and

                        not enough for an up-or-down vote. Yet we're also not saying
                        anything new now; we're just reiterating what has been said
                        before. So the best thing at this point would probably be for
                        further posts to contain either a complete specification for the
                        proposed behavior, or a patch. Then at least we'd have a
                        definite action to take (i.e., get consensus on the
                        specification, or apply and test the patch).</em></span></p></blockquote>

                <p>Contrast the second approach with the first. The second way
                    does not draw a line between you and the others, or accuse them of
                    taking the discussion into a spiral. It talks about "we", which is
                    important whether or not you actually participated in the thread
                    before now, because it reminds everyone that even those who have been
                    silent thus far still have a stake in the thread's outcome. It
                    describes why the thread is going nowhere, but does so without
                    pejoratives or judgementsâit just dispassionately states
                    some facts. Most importantly, it offers a positive course of action,
                    so that instead of people feeling like discussion is being closed off
                    (a restriction against which they can only be tempted to rebel), they
                    will feel as if they're being offered a way to take the conversation
                    to a more constructive level, if they're willing to make the effort.
                    This is a standard the most productive people will naturally want to
                    meet.</p>

                <p>You won't always want a thread to make it to the next level of
                    constructivenessâsometimes you'll want it to just go away. The
                    purpose of your post, then, is to make it do one or the other. If you
                    can tell from the way the thread has gone so far that no one is
                    actually <span class="emphasis"><em>going</em></span> to take the steps you suggested,
                    then your post effectively shuts down the thread without seeming to do
                    so. Of course, there isn't any foolproof way to shut down a thread,
                    and even if there were, you wouldn't want to use it. But asking
                    participants to either make visible progress or stop posting is
                    perfectly defensible, if done diplomatically. Be wary of quashing
                    threads prematurely, however. Some amount of speculative chatter can
                    be productive, depending on the topic, and asking for it to be
                    resolved too quickly will stifle the creative process, as well as make
                    you look impatient.</p>

                <p>Don't expect any thread to stop on a dime. There will probably
                    still be a few posts after yours, either because mails got crossed in
                    the pipe, or because people want to have the last word. This is
                    nothing to worry about, and you don't need to post again. Just let
                    the thread peter out, or not peter out, as the case may be. You can't
                    have complete control; on the other hand, you can expect to have a
                    statistically significant effect across many threads.</p></div>

                <p>Although discussion can meander in any topic, the probability of
                    meandering goes up as the technical difficulty of the topic goes down.
                    After all, the greater the technical complexity, the fewer
                    participants can really follow what's going on. Those who can are
                    likely to be the most experienced developers, who have already taken
                    part in such discussions many times before, and know what sort
                    of behavior is likely to lead to a consensus everyone can live
                    with.</p>

                <p>Thus, consensus is hardest to achieve in technical questions
                    that are simple to understand and easy to have an opinion about, and
                    in "soft" topics such as organization, publicity, funding, etc.
                    People can participate in those arguments forever, because there are
                    no qualifications necessary for doing so, no clear ways to decide (even
                    afterward) if a decision was right or wrong, and because simply
                    outwaiting other discussants is sometimes a successful tactic.</p>

                <p>The principle that the amount of discussion is inversely
                    proportional to the complexity of the topic has been around for a long
                    time, and is known informally as the <em class="firstterm">Bikeshed
                        Effect</em>. Here is Poul-Henning Kamp's explanation of it,
                    from a now-famous post made to BSD developers:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's a long story, or rather it's an old story, but it is quite
                        short actually. C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a book in the early
                        1960'ies, called "Parkinson's Law", which contains a lot of insight
                        into the dynamics of management.</p>

                        <p>[...]</p>

                        <p>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the other vital
                            component is an atomic power-plant, I guess that illustrates the age
                            of the book.</p>

                        <p>Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and
                            get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar
                            atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be
                            tangled up in endless discussions.</p>

                        <p>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so
                            vast, so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, and
                            rather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody else
                            checked all the details before it got this far. Richard P. Feynmann
                            gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point, examples
                            relating to Los Alamos in his books.</p>

                        <p>A bike shed on the other hand. Anyone can build one of those
                            over a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV. So no
                            matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with your
                            proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his
                            job, that he is paying attention, that he
                            is <span class="emphasis"><em>here</em></span>.</p>

                        <p>In Denmark we call it "setting your fingerprint". It is about
                            personal pride and prestige, it is about being able to point somewhere
                            and say "There! <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> did that." It is a strong
                            trait in politicians, but present in most people given the chance.
                            Just think about footsteps in wet cement.</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>(Kamp's complete post is very much worth reading, too; see
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://bikeshed.com/" target="_top">bikeshed.com</a>.)</p>

                <p>Anyone who's ever taken regular part in group decision-making
                    will recognize what Kamp is talking about. However, it is usually
                    impossible to persuade <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> to avoid painting
                    bikesheds. The best you can do is point out that the phenomenon
                    exists, when you see it happening, and persuade the senior
                    developersâthe people whose posts carry the most weightâto
                    drop their paintbrushes early, so at least they're not contributing to
                    the noise. Bikeshed painting parties will never go away entirely, but
                    you can make them shorter and less frequent by spreading an awareness
                    of the phenomenon in the project's culture.</p></div>

                <p>A <em class="firstterm">holy war</em> is a dispute, often but not
                    always over a relatively minor issue, which is not resolvable on the
                    merits of the arguments, but where people feel passionate enough to
                    continue arguing anyway in the hope that their side will prevail.
                    Holy wars are not quite the same as bikeshed painting. People
                    painting bikesheds may be quick to jump in with an opinion, but they
                    won't necessarily feel strongly about it,
                    and indeed will sometimes express other, incompatible opinions, to
                    show that they understand all sides of the issue. In a holy war, on
                    the other hand, understanding the other sides is a sign of weakness.
                    In a holy war, everyone knows there is One Right Answer; they just
                    don't agree on what it is.</p>

                <p>Once a holy war has started, it generally cannot be resolved to
                    everyone's satisfaction. It does no good to point out, in the midst
                    of a holy war, that a holy war is going on. Everyone knows that
                    already. Unfortunately, a common feature of holy wars is disagreement
                    on the very question of <span class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> the dispute is
                    resolvable by continued discussion. Viewed from outside, it is clear
                    that neither side is changing the other's mind. Viewed from inside,
                    the other side is being obtuse and not thinking clearly, but they
                    might come around if browbeaten enough. Now, I am
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> saying there's never a right side in a holy
                    war. Sometimes there isâin the holy wars I've participated
                    in, it's always been my side, of course. But it doesn't matter,
                    because there's no algorithm for convincingly demonstrating that one
                    side or the other is right.</p>

                <p>A common, but unsatisfactory, way people try to resolve holy
                    wars is to say "We've already spent far more time and energy
                    discussing this than it's worth! Can we please just drop it?" There
                    are two problems with this. First, that time and energy has already
                    been spent and can never be recoveredâthe only question now is,
                    how much <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> effort remains? If some people
                    feel that just a little more discussion will resolve the issue in
                    their favor, then it still makes sense (from their point of view) to
                    continue.</p>

                <p>The other problem with asking for the matter to be dropped is
                    that this is often equivalent to allowing one side, the status quo, to
                    declare victory by inaction. And in some cases, the status quo is
                    known to be unacceptable anyway: everyone agrees that some decision
                    must be made, some action taken. Dropping the subject would be worse
                    for everyone than simply giving up the argument would be for anyone.
                    But since that dilemma applies to all equally, it's still possible to
                    end up arguing forever about what to do.</p>

                <p>So how should you handle holy wars?</p>

                <p>The first answer is, try to set things up so they don't happen.
                    This is not as hopeless as it sounds:</p>

                <p>You can anticipate certain standard holy wars: they tend to come
                    up over programming languages, licenses (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#license-compatibility" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">the section
                        called âThe GPL and License Compatibilityâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
      title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10, <i>Legal
                        Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a></span>), reply-to munging (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#reply-to" title="The Great Reply-to Debate">the section called âThe Great
                        Reply-to Debateâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>), and a few
                    other topics. Each project
                    usually has a holy war or two all its own, as well, which longtime
                    developers will quickly become familiar with. The techniques for
                    stopping holy wars, or at least limiting their damage, are pretty much
                    the same everywhere. Even if you are positive your side is right, try
                    to find <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> way to express sympathy and
                    understanding for the points the other side is making. Often the
                    problem in a holy war is that because each side has built its walls
                    as high as possible and made it clear that any other opinion is sheer
                    foolishness, the act of surrendering or changing one's mind becomes
                    psychologically unbearable: it would be an admission not just of being
                    wrong, but of having been <span class="emphasis"><em>certain</em></span> and still being
                    wrong. The way you can make this admission palatable for the other
                    side is to express some uncertainty yourselfâprecisely by
                    showing that you understand the arguments they are making and find
                    them at least sensible, if not finally persuasive. Make a gesture
                    that provides space for a reciprocal gesture, and usually the
                    situation will improve. You are no more or less likely to get the
                    technical result you wanted, but at least you can avoid unnecessary
                    collateral damage to the project's morale.</p>

                <p>When a holy war can't be avoided, decide early how much you
                    care, and then be willing to publicly give up. When you do so, you
                    can say that you're backing out because the holy war isn't worth it,
                    but don't express any bitterness and <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> take
                    the opportunity for a last parting shot at the opposing side's
                    arguments. Giving up is effective only when done gracefully.</p>

                <p>Programming language holy wars are a bit of a special case,
                    because they are often highly technical, yet many people feel
                    qualified to take part in them, and the stakes are very high, since
                    the result may determine what language a good portion of the project's
                    code is written in. The best solution is to choose the language
                    early, with buy-in from influential initial developers, and then
                    defend it on the grounds that it's what you are all comfortable
                    writing in, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> on the grounds that it's better
                    than some other language that could have been used instead. Never let
                    the conversation degenerate into an academic comparison of programming
                    languages (this seems to happen especially often when someone brings
                    up Perl, for some reason); that's a death topic that you must simply
                    refuse to be drawn into.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In any mailing list discussion, it's easy for a small minority
                    to give the impression that there is a great deal of dissent, by
                    flooding the list with numerous lengthy emails. It's a bit like a
                    filibuster, except that the illusion of widespread dissent is even
                    more powerful, because it's divided across an arbitrary number of
                    discrete posts and most people won't bother to keep track of who said
                    what, when. They'll just have an instinctive impression that the topic
                    is very controversial, and wait for the fuss to die down.</p>

                <p>The best way to counteract this effect is to point it out very
                    clearly and provide supporting evidence showing how small the actual
                    number of dissenters is, compared to those in agreement. In order to
                    increase the disparity, you may want to privately poll people who have
                    been mostly silent, but who you suspect would agree with the majority.
                    Don't say anything that suggests the dissenters were deliberately
                    trying to inflate the impression they were making. Chances are they
                    weren't, and even if they were, there would be no strategic advantage
                    to pointing it out. All you need do is show the actual numbers in a
                    side-by-side comparison, and people will realize that their intuition
                    of the situation does not match reality.</p>

                <p>This advice doesn't just apply to issues with clear
                    for-and-against positions. It applies to any discussion where a fuss
                    is being made but it's not clear that most people consider the issue
                    under discussion to be a real problem. After a while, if you agree that
                    the issue is not worthy of action, and can see that it has failed to
                    get much traction (even if it has generated a lot of mails), you can
                    just observe publicly that it's not getting traction. If the "Noisy
                    Minority" effect has been at work, your post will seem like a breath of
                    fresh air. Most people's impression of the discussion up to that
                    point will have been somewhat murky: "Huh, it sure feels like there's
                    some big deal here, because there sure are a lot of posts, but I can't
                    see any clear progress happening." By explaining how the form of the
                    discussion made it appear more turbulent than it really was, you
                    retrospectively give it a new shape, through which people can recast
                    their understanding of what transpired.</p></div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Difficult people are no easier to deal with in electronic forums
                than they are in person. By "difficult" I don't mean "rude". Rude
                people are annoying, but they're not necessarily difficult. This book
                has already discussed how to handle them: comment on the rudeness the
                first time, and from then on, either ignore them or treat them the same
                as anyone else. If they continue being rude, they will usually make
                themselves so unpopular as to have no influence on others in the
                project, so they are a self-containing problem.</p>

            <p>The really difficult cases are people who are not overtly rude,
                but who manipulate or abuse the project's processes in a way that ends
                up costing other people time and energy, yet do not bring any benefit
                to the project<sup>[<a name="idp7945152" href="#ftn.idp7945152" class="footnote">47</a>]</sup>.</p>

            <p>Often, such people look for wedgepoints in the project's
                procedures, to give themselves more influence than they might
                otherwise have. This is much more insidious than mere rudeness,
                because neither the behavior nor the damage it causes is apparent to
                casual observers. A classic example is the filibuster, in which
                someone (always sounding as reasonable as possible, of course) keeps
                claiming that the matter under discussion is not ready for resolution,
                and offers more and more possible solutions, or new viewpoints on old
                solutions, when what is really going on is that he senses that a
                consensus or a ballot is about to form and he doesn't like where it's
                headed. Another example is when there's a debate that won't converge
                on consensus, but the group tries to at least clarify the points of
                disagreement and produce a summary for everyone to refer to from then
                on. The obstructionist, who knows the summary may lead to a result he
                doesn't like, will often try to delay even the summary, by
                relentlessly complicating the question of what should be in it, either
                by objecting to reasonable suggestions or by introducing unexpected
                new items.</p>

                <p>To counteract such behavior, it helps to understand the
                    mentality of those who engage in it. People generally do not do it
                    consciously. No one wakes up in the morning and says to himself:
                    "Today I'm going to cynically manipulate procedural forms in order to
                    be an irritating obstructionist." Instead, such actions are often
                    preceded by a semi-paranoid feeling of being shut out of group
                    interactions and decisions. The person feels he is not being taken
                    seriously, or (in the more severe cases) that there is almost a
                    conspiracy against himâthat the other project members have decided to
                    form an exclusive club, of which he is not a member. This then
                    justifies, in his mind, taking rules literally and engaging in a
                    formal manipulation of the project's procedures, in order
                    to <span class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span> everyone else take him seriously. In
                    extreme cases, the person can even believe that he is fighting a
                    lonely battle to save the project from itself.</p>

                <p>It is the nature of such an attack from within that not everyone
                    will notice it at the same time, and some people may not see it at all
                    unless presented with very strong evidence. This means that
                    neutralizing it can be quite a bit of work. It's not enough to
                    persuade yourself that it's happening; you have to marshal enough
                    evidence to persuade others too, and then you have to distribute that
                    evidence in a thoughtful way.</p>

                <p>Given that it's so much work to fight, it's often better just to
                    tolerate it for a while. Think of it like a parasitic but mild
                    disease: if it's not too debilitating, the project can afford to
                    remain infected, and medicine might have harmful side effects.
                    However, if it gets too damaging to tolerate, then it's time for
                    action. Start gathering notes on the patterns you see. Make sure to
                    include references to public archivesâthis is one of the reasons
                    the project keeps records, so you might as well use them. Once you've
                    got a good case built, start having private conversations with other
                    project participants. Don't tell them what you've observed; instead,
                    first ask them what they've observed. This may be your last chance to
                    get unfiltered feedback about how others see the troublemaker's
                    behavior; once you start openly talking about it, opinion will
                    become polarized and no one will be able to remember what he
                    formerly thought about the matter.</p>

                <p>If private discussions indicate that at least some others see
                    the problem too, then it's time to do something. That's when you
                    have to get <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> cautious, because it's very
                    easy for this sort of person to try to make it appear as though you're
                    picking on them unfairly. Whatever you do, never accuse them of
                    maliciously abusing the project's procedures, of being paranoid, or, in
                    general, of any of the other things that you suspect are probably
                    true. Your strategy should be to look both more reasonable and more
                    concerned with the overall welfare of the project, with the goal of
                    either reforming the person's behavior, or getting them to go away
                    permanently. Depending on the other developers, and your relationship
                    with them, it may be advantageous to gather allies privately first.
                    Or it may not; that might just create ill will behind the scenes, if
                    people think you're engaging in an improper whispering
                    campaign.</p>

                <p>Remember that although the other person may be the one behaving
                    destructively, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> will be the one who appears
                    destructive if you make a public charge that you can't back up. Be
                    sure to have plenty of examples to demonstrate what you're saying, and
                    say it as gently as possible while still being direct. You may not
                    persuade the person in question, but that's okay as long as you
                    persuade everyone else.</p></div>

                <p>I remember only a few situations, in more than 20 years of working
                    in free software, where things got so bad that we actually had to ask
                    someone to stop posting altogether. In the example I'll use here, the
                    person was not rude, and sincerely wanted only to be helpful. He just
                    didn't know when to post and when not to post. Our lists were open to the
                    public, and he was posting so often, and asking questions on so many
                    different topics, that it was getting to be a noise problem for the
                    community. We'd already tried asking him nicely to do a little more
                    research for answers before posting, but that had no effect.</p>

                <p>The strategy that finally worked is a perfect example of how to
                    build a strong case on neutral, quantitative data. One of our
                    developers, Brian Fitzpatrick, did some digging in the archives, and
                    then sent the
                    following message privately to a few developers. The offender (the
                    third name on the list below, shown here as "J. Random") had very
                    little history with the project, and had contributed no code or
                    documentation. Yet he was the third most active poster on the mailing
                    lists:</p><pre class="screen">From: "Brian W. Fitzpatrick" &lt;fitz@collab.net&gt;

Subject: The Subversion Energy Sink
Date: Wed, 12 Nov 2003 23:37:47 -0600

In the last 25 days, the top 6 posters to the svn [dev|users] list have
been:

    294  kfogel@collab.net
    236  "C. Michael Pilato" &lt;cmpilato@collab.net&gt;
    220  "J. Random" &lt;jrandom@problematic-poster.com&gt;
    176  Branko Äibej &lt;brane@xbc.nu&gt;
    130  Philip Martin &lt;philip@codematters.co.uk&gt;
    126  Ben Collins-Sussman &lt;sussman@collab.net&gt;

I would say that five of these people are contributing to Subversion
hitting 1.0 in the near future.

I would also say that one of these people is consistently drawing time
and energy from the other 5, not to mention the list as a whole, thus
(albeit unintentionally) slowing the development of Subversion.  I did
not do a threaded analysis, but vgrepping my Subversion mail spool tells
me that every mail from this person is responded to at least once by at
least 2 of the other 5 people on the above list.

I think some sort of radical intervention is necessary here, even if we
do scare the aforementioned person away.  Niceties and kindness have
already proven to have no effect.

dev@subversion is a mailing list to facilitate development of a version
control system, not a group therapy session.

-Fitz, attempting to wade through three days of svn mail that he let
 pile up
</pre>
                <p>Though it might not seem so at first, J. Random's behavior was a
                    classic case of abusing project procedures. He wasn't doing something
                    obvious like trying to filibuster a vote, but he was taking advantage
                    of the mailing list's policy of relying on self-moderation by its
                    members. We left it to each individual's judgement when to post and
                    on what topics. Thus, we had no procedural recourse for dealing with
                    someone who either did not have, or would not exercise, such judgement.
                    There was no rule one could point to and say the fellow was violating
                    it, yet everyone except him knew that his frequent posting was getting
                    to be a serious problem.</p>

                <p>Fitz's strategy was, in retrospect, masterful. He gathered
                    damning quantitative evidence, but then distributed it discreetly,
                    sending it first to a few people whose support would be key in any
                    drastic action. They agreed that some sort of action was necessary,
                    and in the end we called J. Random on the phone, described the problem
                    to him directly, and asked him to simply stop posting. He never
                    really did understand the reasons why; if he had been capable
                    of understanding, he probably would have exercised appropriate
                    judgement in the first place. But he agreed to stop posting, and the
                    mailing lists became useable again. Part of the reason this strategy
                    worked was, perhaps, the implicit threat that we could start
                    restricting his posts via the moderation software normally used for
                    preventing spam (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#spam-prevention" title="Spam Prevention">the section called âSpam
                        Preventionâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>). But the
                    reason we were able to have that option in reserve was that Fitz had
                    gathered the necessary support from key people first.</p></div>

            <p>The price of success is heavy in the open source world. As your
                software gets more popular, the number of people who show up looking
                for information increases dramatically, while the number of people
                able to provide information increases much more slowly. Furthermore,
                even if the ratio were evenly balanced, there is still a fundamental
                scalability problem with the way most open source projects handle
                communications. Consider mailing lists, for example. Most projects
                have a mailing list for general user questionsâsometimes the
                list's name is "users", "discuss", "help", or something else.
                Whatever its name, the purpose of the list is always the same: to
                provide a place where people can get their questions answered, while
                others watch and (presumably) absorb knowledge from observing these
                exchanges.</p>

            <p>These mailing lists work very well up to a few thousand users
                and/or a couple of hundred posts a day. But somewhere after that, the
                system starts to break down, because every subscriber sees every post;
                if the number of posts to the list begins to exceed what any
                individual reader can process in a day, the list becomes a burden to
                its members. Imagine, for instance, if Microsoft had such a mailing
                list for Windows. Windows has hundreds of millions of users; if
                even one-tenth of one percent of them had questions in a given
                twenty-four hour period, then this hypothetical list would get
                hundreds of thousands of posts per day! Such a list could never
                exist, of course, because no one would stay subscribed to it.
                This problem is not limited to mailing lists; the same logic applies
                to IRC channels, other discussion forums, indeed to any system in
                which a group hears questions from individuals. The implications are
                ominous: the usual open source model of massively parallelized support
                simply does not scale to the levels needed for world

            <p>There will be no explosion when forums reach the breaking point.
                There is just a quiet negative feedback effect: people unsubscribe
                from the lists, or leave the IRC channel, or at any rate stop
                bothering to ask questions, because they can see they won't be heard
                in all the noise. As more and more people make this highly rational
                choice, the forum's activity will seem to stay at a manageable level.
                But it is staying manageable precisely because the rational (or at
                least, experienced) people have started looking elsewhere for
                informationâwhile the inexperienced people stay behind and
                continue posting. In other words, one side effect of continuing to
                use unscalable communications models as a project grows is that the
                average <span class="emphasis"><em>quality</em></span> of communications tends to go
                down. As the benefit/cost ratio of using high-population forums
                goes down, naturally those with the experience to do so start to look
                elsewhere for answers first. Adjusting communications mechanisms to
                cope with project growth therefore involves two related strategies:</p>

            <div class="orderedlist">
                <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Recognizing when particular parts of a forum are
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> suffering unbounded growth, even
                        if the forum as a whole is, and separating those parts
                        off into new, more specialized forums (i.e., don't let
                        the good be dragged down by the bad).</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Making sure there are many automated sources
                        of information available, and that they are kept
                        organized, up-to-date, and easy to find.</p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Strategy (1) is usually not too hard. Most projects start out
                with one main forum: a general discussion mailing list, on which
                feature ideas, design questions, and coding problems can all be hashed
                out. Everyone involved with the project is on the list. After a
                while, it usually becomes clear that the list has evolved into several
                distinct topic-based sublists. For example, some threads are clearly
                about development and design; others are user questions of the "How do
                I do X?" variety; maybe there's a third topic family centered around
                processing bug reports and enhancement requests; and so on. A given
                individual, of course, might participate in many different thread
                types, but the important thing is that there is not a lot of overlap
                between the types themselves. They could be divided into separate
                lists without causing harmful balkanization, because the threads
                rarely cross topic boundaries.</p>

            <p>Actually doing this division is a two-step process. You create
                the new list (or IRC channel, or whatever it is to be), and then you
                spend whatever time is necessary gently nagging and reminding people
                to <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the new forums appropriately. That latter
                step can last for weeks, but eventually people will get the idea. You
                simply have to make a point of always telling the sender when a post
                is sent to the wrong destination, and do so visibly, so that other
                people are encouraged to help out with routing. It's also useful to
                have a web page providing a guide to all the lists available; your
                responses can simply reference that web page and, as a bonus, the
                recipient may learn something about looking for guidelines before
                posting.</p>

            <p>Strategy (2) is an ongoing process, lasting the lifetime of the
                project and involving many participants. Of course it is partly a
                matter of having up-to-date documentation (see
                <a class="xref" href="#documentation" title="Documentation">the section called âDocumentationâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>) and making sure to
                point people there. But it is also much more than that; the sections
                that follow discuss this strategy in detail.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-archives"></a>Conspicuous Use of Archives</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Typically, all communications in an open source project, except
                    sometimes IRC conversations, are archived. The archives are public
                    and searchable, and have referential stability: that is, once a given
                    piece of information is recorded at a particular address (URL), it
                    stays at that address forever.</p>

                <p>Use those archives as much as possible, and as conspicuously as
                    possible. Even when you know the answer to some question off the top
                    of your head, if you think there's a reference in the archives that
                    contains the answer, spend the time to dig it up and present it.
                    Every time you do that in a publicly visible way, some people learn
                    for the first time that the archives are there, and that searching in
                    them can produce answers. Also, by referring to the archives instead
                    of rewriting the advice, you reinforce the social norm against
                    duplicating information. Why have the same answer in two different
                    places? When the number of places it can be found is kept to a
                    minimum, people who have found it before are more likely to remember
                    what to search for to find it again. Well-placed references also
                    contribute to the quality of search results in general, because they
                    strengthen the targeted resource's ranking in Internet search
                    engines.</p>

                <p>There are times when duplicating information makes sense,
                    however. For example, suppose there's a response already in the
                    archives, not from you, saying:</p><pre class="screen">It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  To
unfrobnicate them, run these steps:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Run the 'defrobnicate' program that ships with Scanley.
3. Start up the server.
</pre>
                <p>Then, months later, you see another post indicating that
                    someone's indexes have become frobnicated. You search the archives
                    and come up with the old response above, but you realize it's missing
                    some steps (perhaps by mistake, or perhaps because the software has
                    changed since that post was written). The classiest way to handle
                    this is to post a new, more complete set of instructions, and
                    explicitly obsolete the old post by mentioning it:</p><pre class="screen">It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  We
saw this problem back in July, and J. Random posted a solution at
http://blahblahblah/blah.  Below is a more complete description of
how to unfrobnicate your indexes, based on J. Random's instructions
but extending them a bit:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Become the user the Scanley server normally runs as.
3. As that user, run the 'defrobnicate' program on the indexes.
4. Run Scanley by hand to see if the indexes work now.
5. Restart the server.
</pre>
                <p>(In an ideal world, it would be possible to attach a note to the
                    old post, saying that there is newer information available and
                    pointing to the new post. However, I don't know of any archiving
                    software that offers an "obsoleted by" tag. This is another reason
                    why creating dedicated web pages with answers to common questions is a
                    good idea.)</p>

                <p>Archives are probably most often searched for answers to
                    technical questions, but their importance to the project goes well
                    beyond that. If a project's formal guidelines are its statutory law,
                    the archives are its common law: a record of all decisions made and
                    how they were arrived at. In any recurring discussion, it's pretty
                    much obligatory nowadays to start with an archive search. This allows
                    you to begin the discussion with a summary of the current state of
                    things, anticipate objections, prepare rebuttals, and possibly
                    discover angles you hadn't thought of. Also, the other participants
                    will <span class="emphasis"><em>expect</em></span> you to have done an archive search.
                    Even if the previous discussions went nowhere, you should include
                    pointers to them when you re-raise the topic, so people can see for
                    themselves a) that they went nowhere, and b) that you did your
                    homework, and therefore are probably saying something now that has not
                    been said before.</p>

                    <p>All of the preceding advice applies to more than just mailing
                        list archives. Having particular pieces of information at stable,
                        conveniently findable addresses should be an organizing principle for
                        all of the project's information. Let's take the project FAQ as a
                        case study.</p>

                    <p>How do people use a FAQ?</p>

                    <div class="orderedlist">
                        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to search in it for specific words and phrases.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to browse it, soaking up information without
                                necessarily looking for answers to specific questions.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They expect search engines such as Google to know about the
                                FAQ's content, so that searches can result in FAQ entries.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to refer other people directly to specific
                                items in the FAQ.</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to add new material to the FAQ, but
                                note that this happens much less often than answers are
                                looked upâFAQs are far more often read from than
                                written to.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p><a name="html-named-anchors-and-ids"></a>Point 1 implies that the FAQ
                        should be available in some sort of textual format. Points 2 and 3
                        imply that the FAQ should be available as an HTML page, with point 2
                        additionally indicating that the HTML should be designed for
                        readability (i.e., you'll want some control over its look and feel),
                        and should have a table of contents. Point 4 means that each
                        individual entry in the FAQ should be directly addresseable via a
                        direct URL (e.g., using HTML IDs and named anchors, tags that allow
                        people to reach a particular location on the page). Point 5 means the
                        source files for the FAQ should be available in a convenient way (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#version-everything" title="Version everything">the section called
                            âVersion everythingâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                                                 title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                            <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>), in a format that's
                        easy to edit.</p>

                    <p>Formatting the FAQ like this is just one example of how to make
                        a resource presentable. The same propertiesâdirect
                        searchability, availability to major Internet search engines,
                        browsability, referential stability, and (where applicable)
                        editabilityâapply to other web pages, to the source code tree,
                        to the bug tracker, to Q&amp;A forums, etc. It just happens that most
                        mailing list archiving software long ago recognized the importance of
                        these properties, which is why mailing lists tend to have this
                        functionality natively, while other formats may require a little extra
                        effort on the maintainer's part. <a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers"

                <p>As a project acquires history and complexity, the amount of data
                    each new incoming participant must absorb increases. Those who have been
                    with the project a long time were able to learn, and invent, the
                    project's conventions as they went along. They will often not be
                    consciously aware of what a huge body of tradition has accumulated, and
                    may be surprised at how many missteps recent newcomers seem to make.
                    Of course, the issue is not that the newcomers are of any lower
                    quality than before; it's that they face a bigger acculturation burden
                    than newcomers did in the past.</p>

                <p>The traditions a project accumulates are as much about how to
                    communicate and preserve information as they are about coding
                    standards and other technical minutae. We've already looked at both
                    sorts of standards, in
                    <a class="xref" href="#developer-documentation" title="Developer documentation">the section called

<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span> respectively, and
                    examples are given there. What this section is about is how to keep
                    such guidelines up-to-date as the project evolves, especially
                    guidelines about how communications are managed, because those are the
                    ones that change the most as the project grows in size and
                    complexity.</p>

                <p>First, watch for patterns in how people get confused. If you
                    see the same situations coming up over and over, especially with new
                    participants, chances are there is a guideline that needs to be
                    documented but isn't. Second, don't get tired of saying the same
                    things over and over again, and don't <span class="emphasis"><em>sound</em></span> like
                    you're tired of saying them. You and other project veterans will have
                    to repeat yourselves often; this is an inevitable side effect of the
                    arrival of newcomers.</p>

                <p>Every web page, every mailing list message, and every IRC channel
                    should be considered advertising spaceânot for commercial
                    advertisements, but for ads about your project's own resources. What
                    you put in that space depends on the demographics of those likely to
                    read it. An IRC channel for user questions, for example, is likely to
                    get people who have never interacted with the project
                    beforeâoften someone who has just installed the software, and
                    has a question he'd like answered immediately (after all, if it
                    could wait, he'd have sent it to a mailing list instead, which would
                    probably use less of his total time, although it would take longer
                    for an answer to come back). Most people don't make a permanent
                    investment in a support IRC channel; they'll show up, ask their question,

                <p>With mailing lists, the "ad space" is a tiny footer appended to
                    every message. Most projects put subscription/unsubscription
                    instructions there, and perhaps a pointer to the project's home page
                    or FAQ page as well. You might think that anyone subscribed to the
                    list would know where to find those things, and they probably
                    doâbut many more people than just subscribers see those mailing
                    list messages. An archived post may be linked to from many places;
                    indeed, some posts become so widely known that they eventually have
                    more readers off the list than on it.</p>

                <p>Formatting can make a big difference. For example, in the
                    Subversion project, we were having limited success using the
                    bug-filtering technique described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">the section called
                        âPre-Filtering the Bug Trackerâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>. Many bogus
                    bug reports were still being filed by inexperienced people, and each
                    time it happened, the filer had to be educated in exactly the same way
                    as the 500 people before him. One day, after one of our developers had
                    finally gotten to the end of his rope and flamed some poor user who
                    didn't read the ticket tracker guidelines carefully enough, another
                    developer decided this pattern had gone on long enough. He suggested
                    that we reformat the ticket tracker front page so that the most
                    important part, the injunction to discuss the bug on the mailing lists
                    or IRC channels before filing, would stand out in huge, bold red
                    letters, on a bright yellow background, centered prominently above
                    everything else on the page. We did so (it's been reformatted a bit
                    since then, but it's still very prominentâyou can see the results at

                    <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html" target="_top">subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html</a>),
                    and
                    the result was a noticeable drop in the rate of bogus ticket filings.
                    The project still gets them, of courseâit always willâbut the rate
                    has slowed considerably, even as the number of users increases. The
                    outcome is not only that the bug database contains less junk, but that
                    those who respond to ticket filings stay in a better mood, and are more
                    likely to remain friendly when responding to one of the now-rare bogus
                    filings. This improves both the project's image and the mental health
                    of its participants.</p>

                <p>The lesson for us was that merely writing up the guidelines was
                    not enough. We also had to put them where they'd be seen by those who
                    need them most, and format them in such a way that their status as
                    introductory material would be immediately clear to people unfamiliar
                    with the project.</p>

                <p>Static web pages are not the only venue for advertising the
                    project's customs. A certain amount of interactive policing (in the
                    friendly-reminder sense, not the handcuffs-and-jail sense) is also
                    required. All peer review, even the commit reviews described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the section called
                        âPractice Conspicuous Code Reviewâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>, should include review
                    of people's conformance or non-conformance with project norms,
                    especially with regard to communications conventions.</p>

                <p>Another example from the Subversion project: we settled on a
                    convention of "r12908" to mean "revision 12908 in the version control
                    repository." The lower-case "r" prefix is easy to type, and because
                    it's half the height of the digits, it makes an easily-recognizable
                    block of text when combined with the digits. Of course, settling on
                    the convention doesn't mean that everyone will begin using it
                    consistently right away. Thus, when a commit mail comes in with a log
                    message like this:</p><pre class="screen">------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patch from J. Random Contributor &lt;jrcontrib@gmail.com&gt;

* trunk/contrib/client-side/psvn/psvn.el:
  Fixed some typos from revision 12828.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
                <p>...part of reviewing that commit is to say "By the way, please
                    use 'r12828', not 'revision 12828' when referring to past changes."
                    This isn't just pedantry; it's important as much for automatic
                    parsability as for human readership.</p>

                <p>By following the general principle that there should be
                    canonical referral methods for common entities, and that these
                    referral methods should be used consistently everywhere, the project
                    in effect exports certain standards. Those standards enable people to
                    write tools that present the project's communications in more useable
                    waysâfor example, a revision formatted as "r12828" could be
                    transformed into a live link into the repository browsing system.
                    This would be harder to do if the revision were written as "revision
                    12828", both because that form could be divided across a line break,
                    and because it's less distinct (the word "revision" will often appear
                    alone, and groups of numbers will often appear alone, whereas the
                    combination "r12828" can only mean a revision number). Similar
                    concerns apply to ticket numbers, FAQ items, etc.</p>

                <p>Even for entities where there is not an obvious short, canonical
                    form, people should still be encouraged to provide key pieces of
                    information consistently. For example, when referring to a mailing
                    list message, don't just give the sender and subject; also give the
                    archive URL <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the Message-ID header. The last
                    allows people who have their own copy of the mailing list (people
                    sometimes keep offline copies, for example to use on a laptop while
                    traveling) to unambiguously identify the right message in a search even if they
                    don't have access to the archives. The sender and subject wouldn't be
                    enough, because the same person might make several posts in the same
                    thread, even on the same day.</p>

                <p>The more a project grows, the more important this sort of
                    consistency becomes. Consistency means that everywhere people look,
                    they see the same patterns being followed, and start to follow
                    those patterns themselves. This, in turn, reduces the number of
                    questions they need to ask. The burden of having a million readers is
                    no greater than that of having one; scalability problems start to
                    arise only when a certain percentage of those readers ask questions.
                    As a project grows, therefore, it must reduce that percentage by
                    increasing the density and findability of information, so that any
                    given person is more likely to find what he needs without having to
                    ask.</p></div>

            <p>One of the trickiest things about managing an open source
                project is getting people to be thoughtful about which forum they
                choose for different kinds of communications. It's tricky partly
                because it's not immediately obvious that it matters. During any
                given conversation, the participants are mostly concerned with what
                the people involved are saying, and won't usually stop to think about
                whether or not the forum itself gives others who
                <span class="emphasis"><em>might</em></span> want to take part the opportunity to do
                so.</p>

            <p>For example, a real-time forum like IRC is terrific for quick
                questions, for opportunistic synchronization of work, for reminding
                someone of something they promised to do, etc. But it's not a good
                forum for making decisions that affect the whole project, because the
                people who take part in a conversation in IRC are just whoever
                happened to be in the channel at that moment&nbsp;â&nbsp;it's
                very dependent on work schedules, time zones, etc. On the other hand,
                the development mailing list is a great place for making formal
                project-wide decisions, since every interested party will have an
                opportunity to see and respond to the relevant posts, even though it's
                not as well-suited to quick, real-time interactions as IRC is.</p>

            <p>Another example comes up frequently in bug tracker usage,
                especially in the last few years as bug trackers have become so well
                integrated with email. Sometimes people will be drawn into a
                discussion in a bug ticket<sup>[<a name="idp8043904" href="#ftn.idp8043904"
                                                   class="footnote">49</a>]</sup> and because they simply see
                project-related
                emails coming in to their email client, they treat the discussion as
                though it's happening on the real development list. But it's not:
                anyone who wasn't watching that bug and wasn't explicitly invited into
                the conversation won't even be aware it's happening. If things are
                discussed in that bug ticket that go beyond the scope of just that one
                bug, they'll be discussed without input from people who should at
                least have had a chance to participate.</p>

            <p>The solution to this is to encourage conscious, intentional
                forum changes. If a discussion starts to get into questions beyond
                the scope of its original forum, then at some point someone involved
                should ask that the conversation move over to the main development
                list or some other wider forum.</p>

            <p>It's not enough for you to do this on your own. You have to
                create a culture where it's normal for everyone to do it, so everyone
                thinks about forum appropriateness as a matter of course, and feels
                comfortable raising questions of forum whenever necessary in any
                discussion. Obviously, documenting the practice will help (see <a class="xref" href="#written-rules"
                                                                                  title="Writing It All Down">the
                    section called âWriting It All Downâ</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure"
                                                                         title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>), but you'll probably also
                need to remind people of it often, especially when your project is
                starting out. A good rule of thumb is: if the conversation looks
                convergent, then it's okay to keep it in the bug ticket or other
                original forum. But if it looks likely to diverge for a while (e.g.,
                widening into philosophical issues about how the software should
                behave, or raising design issues that go beyond just the one bug)
                before it converges, then take the discussion to a broader forum,
                usually the development mailing list.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>When a discussion moves from one place to another, cross-link
                    between the old and new place. For example, if discussion moves from
                    the ticket tracker to the mailing list, link to the mailing list
                    thread from the ticket, and mention the original ticket at the start
                    of the new list thread. It's important for someone following the
                    ticket to be able to reach the later discussion; it's also important
                    for someone who encounters the ticket a year later to be able to
                    follow to where the conversation went to in the mailing list archives.
                    The person who does the move may find this cross-linking slightly
                    laborious, but open source is fundamentally a writer-responsible
                    culture. It's more important to make things easy for the tens or
                    hundreds of people who may read the bug than for the three or five
                    people writing about it.</p>

                <p>It's also fine to take important conclusions or summaries from
                    the list discussion and paste them into the ticket at the end, if that
                    will make things convenient for readers. A common idiom is to move
                    discussion to the mailing list, put a link to that thread in the
                    ticket, and then when the discussion finishes, paste the final summary
                    into the ticket (along with a link to the message containing that
                    summary), so someone browsing the ticket later can easily see what
                    conclusion was reached without having to click to somewhere else or do
                    detective work. Note that the usual "two masters" data duplication
                    problem does not exist here, because both archives and ticket comments
                    are usually static, unchangeable data anyway.</p></div>

            <p>In free software, there is a fairly smooth continuum between
                purely internal discussions and public relations statements. This is
                partly because the target audience is always ill-defined: given that
                most or all posts are publicly accessible, the project doesn't have
                full control over the impression the world gets. Someoneâsay, a
                <a class="ulink" href="http://slashdot.org/" target="_top">slashdot.org</a>
                editorâmay draw millions of readers' attention to a post that no
                one ever expected to be seen outside the project. This is a fact of
                life that all open source projects live with, but in practice, the
                risk is usually small. In general, the announcements that the project
                most wants publicized are the ones that will be most publicized,
                assuming you use the right mechanisms to indicate relative
                newsworthiness to the outside world.</p>

            <p>For major announcements, there tend to be a few main channels of
                distribution, on which announcements should be made as nearly
                simultaneously as possible:</p>

                        should be a very brief synopsis that links to the press

                        purpose of a press release is to provide a single,
                        canonical "announcement object" that other sites can link
                        to, so make sure it is structured accordingly: either as
                        one web page per release, as a discrete blog entry, or
                        as some other kind of entity that can be linked to while
                        still being kept distinct from other press releases in the
                        same area.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Make sure the announcement gets broadcast by any
                        relevant Twitter handles, and goes out on any news
                        channels or RSS feeds. (The latter may happen
                        automatically when you publish announcement, depending on
                        how things are set up at your site.)</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>If the announcement is about a new release of the

                        creating the entry
                        in the first place). Every time you update a Freecode
                        entry, that entry goes onto the Freecode change list
                        for the day. The change list is updated not only on
                        Freecode itself, but on various portal sites (including

                        which are watched eagerly by
                        hordes of people. Freecode also offers the same data via
                        RSS feed, so people who are not subscribed to your
                        project's own RSS feed might still see the announcement

                        Unlike

                        readers agree with you, your announcement will end up on
                        the front page. Please use some judgement: if your
                        project is not in wide usage yet and there is not some
                        specific reason why this announcement would be interesting
                        to that audience, don't waste their time with it. There's
                        little point for an open source project to compete in a
                        marketing arms race. Accurate and well-targeted
                        announcements are your best strategy. (Similar advice

                        because that's a fairly standard convention now, and the
                        list's charter should make it clear that it is very
                        low-traffic, reserved for major project announcements.
                        Most of those announcements will be about new releases of
                        the software, but occasionally other events, such as a
                        fundraising drive, the discovery of a security
                        vulnerability (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#security" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">the section called

                        well. Because it is low traffic and used only for
                        important things, the <code class="literal">announce</code> list
                        typically has the highest subscribership of any mailing
                        list in the project (of course, this means you shouldn't
                        abuse itâconsider carefully before posting). To
                        avoid random people making announcements, or worse, spam
                        getting through, the <code class="literal">announce</code> list must
                        always be moderated.</p></li>

            <p>Try to make the announcements in all these places at the same
                time, as nearly as possible. People might get confused if they see an
                announcement on the mailing list but then don't see it reflected on
                the project's home page or in its press releases area. If you get the
                various changes (emails, web page edits, etc.) queued up and
                then send them all in a row, you can keep the window of inconsistency
                very small.</p>

            <p>For a less important event, you can eliminate some or all of the
                above outlets. The event will still be noticed by the outside world
                in direct proportion to its importance. For example, while a new
                release of the software is a major event, merely setting the date of
                the next release, while still somewhat newsworthy, is not nearly as
                important as the release itself. Setting a date is worth an email to
                the daily mailing lists (not the announce list), and an update of the
                project's timeline or status web page, but no more.</p>

            <p>However, you might still see that date appearing in discussions
                elsewhere on the Internet, wherever there are people interested in the
                project. People who are lurkers on your mailing lists, just listening
                and never saying anything, are not necessarily silent elsewhere. Word
                of mouth gives very broad distribution; you should count on it, and
                construct even minor announcements in such a way as to encourage
                accurate informal transmission. Specifically, posts that you expect
                to be quoted should have a clearly meant-to-be-quoted portion, just as
                though you were writing a formal press release. For example:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Just a progress update: we're planning to
                    release
                    version 2.0 of Scanley in mid-August 2005. You can always check
                    http://www.scanley.org/status.html for updates. The major new
                    feature will be regular-expression searches.</em></span></p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Other new features include:&nbsp;... There will
                        also be various bugfixes, including:&nbsp;...</em></span></p></blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>The first paragraph is short, gives the two most important
                pieces of information (the release date and the major new feature),
                and a URL to visit for further news. If that paragraph is the only
                thing that crosses someone's screen, you're still doing pretty well.
                The rest of the mail could be lost without affecting the gist of the
                content. Of course, sometimes people will link to the entire mail
                anyway, but just as often, they'll quote only a small part. Given that
                the latter is a possibility, you might as well make it easy for them,
                and in the bargain get some influence over what gets quoted.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="security"></a>Announcing Security Vulnerabilities</h3></div>

                </div>
                <p>Handling a security vulnerability is different from handling any
                    other kind of bug report. In free software, doing things openly and
                    transparently is normally almost a religious credo. Every step of the
                    standard bug-handling process is visible to all who care to watch: the
                    arrival of the initial report, the ensuing discussion, and the
                    eventual fix.</p>

                <p>Security bugs are different. They can compromise users' data,
                    and possibly users' entire computers. To discuss such a problem
                    openly would be to advertise its existence to the entire
                    worldâincluding to all the parties who might make malicious use
                    of the bug. Even merely committing a fix effectively announces the
                    bug's existence (there are potential attackers who watch the commit
                    logs of public projects, systematically looking for changes that
                    indicate security problems in the pre-change code). Most open source
                    projects have settled on approximately the same set of steps to handle
                    this conflict between openness and secrecy, based on the these basic
                    guidelines:</p>

                <div class="orderedlist">
                    <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Don't talk about the bug publicly until a fix is
                            available; then supply the fix (packaged as a release) at
                            exactly the same moment you announce the bug.</p></li>
                        <li class="listitem"><p>Come up with that fix as fast as you
                            canâespecially if someone outside the project
                            reported the bug, because then you know there's at least
                            one person outside the project who is able to exploit the
                            vulnerability.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>In practice, those principles lead to a fairly standardized
                    series of steps, which are described in the sections below.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="Receive the report">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-receiving"></a>Receive the report</h4></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Obviously, a project needs the ability to receive security bug
                        reports from anyone. But the regular bug reporting channels won't do,
                        because they can be watched by anyone too. Therefore, have a separate
                        mailing list or contact form for receiving security bug reports. That
                        forum must not have publicly readable archives, and its subscribership must
                        be strictly controlledâonly long-time, trusted developers can be
                        on the list. If you need a formal definition of "trusted", you can
                        use "anyone who has had commit access for two years or more" or
                        something like that, to avoid favoritism. This is the group that will
                        handle security bugs.</p>

                    <p>Ideally, the security list should not be spam-protected or
                        moderated, since you don't want an important report to get filtered
                        out or delayed just because no moderators happened to be online that
                        weekend. If you do use automated spam-protection software, try to
                        configure it with high-tolerance settings; it's better to let a few spams
                        through than to miss a vulnerability report.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Develop the fix quietly">
                    <div class="titlepage">
                        <div>
                            <div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-finding-a-fix"></a>Develop the fix quietly</h4>

                    </div>
                    <p>So what does the security list do when it receives a report?
                        The first task is to evaluate the problem's severity and
                        urgency:</p>

                    <div class="orderedlist">
                        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                            <li class="listitem"><p>How serious is the vulnerability? Does it allow a
                                malicious attacker to take over the computer of someone
                                who uses your software? Or does it, say, merely leak
                                information about the sizes of some of their files?</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p>How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability? Can
                                an attack be scripted, or does it require circumstantial
                                knowledge, educated guessing, and luck?</p></li>
                            <li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Who</em></span> reported the problem to
                                you? The answer to this question doesn't change the
                                nature of the vulnerability, of course, but it does give
                                you an idea of how many other people might know about it.
                                If the report comes from one of the project's own
                                developers, you can breathe a little easier (but only a
                                little), because you can trust them not to have told
                                anyone else about it. On the other hand, if it came in an
                                email from <code class="literal">anonymous14@globalhackerz.net</code>,
                                then you'd better act as fast as you can. The person did
                                you a favor by informing you of the problem at all, but you
                                have no idea how many other people she's told, or how long
                                she'll wait before exploiting the vulnerability on live
                                installations.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p>Note that the difference we're talking about here is often just
                        a narrow range between <span class="emphasis"><em>urgent</em></span>
                        and <span class="emphasis"><em>extremely&nbsp;urgent</em></span>. Even when the report
                        comes from a known, friendly source, there could be other people on
                        the Net who discovered the bug long ago and just haven't reported it.
                        The only time things aren't urgent is when the bug inherently does not
                        compromise security very severely.</p>

                    <p>The "<code class="literal">anonymous14@globalhackerz.net</code>" example
                        is not facetious, by the way. You really may get bug reports from
                        identity-cloaked people who, by their words and behavior, never quite
                        clarify whether they're on your side or not. It doesn't matter: if
                        they've reported the security hole to you, they'll feel they've done
                        you a good turn, and you should respond in kind. Thank them for the
                        report, give them a date on or before which you plan to release a
                        public fix, and keep them in the loop. Sometimes they may
                        give <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> a dateâthat is, an implicit threat
                        to publicize the bug on a certain date, whether you're ready or not.
                        This may feel like a bullying power play, but it's more likely a
                        preÃ«mptive action resulting from past disappointment with
                        unresponsive software producers who didn't take security reports
                        seriously enough. Either way, you can't afford to tick this person
                        off. After all, if the bug is severe, she has knowledge that could
                        cause your users big problems. Treat such reporters well, and hope
                        that they treat you well.</p>

                    <p>Another frequent reporter of security bugs is the security
                        professional, someone who audits code for a living and keeps up on the
                        latest news of software vulnerabilities. These people usually have
                        experience on both sides of the fenceâthey've both received and
                        sent reports, probably more than most developers in your project have.
                        They too will usually give a deadline for fixing a vulnerability
                        before going public. The deadline may be somewhat negotiable, but
                        that's up to the reporter; deadlines have become recognized among
                        security professionals as pretty much the only reliable way to get
                        organizations to address security problems promptly. So don't treat
                        the deadline as rude; it's a time-honored tradition, and there are
                        good reasons for it. Negotiate if you absolutely must, but remember
                        that the reporter holds all the cards.</p>

                    <p>Once you know the severity and urgency, you can start working on
                        a fix. There is sometimes a tradeoff between doing a fix elegantly
                        and doing it speedily; this is why you must agree on the urgency
                        before you start. Keep discussion of the fix restricted to the
                        security list members, of course, plus the original reporter (if she
                        wants to be involved) and any developers who need to be brought in for
                        technical reasons.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not commit the fix to any public
                        repository</em></span> before the go-public date. If you were to
                        commit it publicly, even with an
                        innocent-looking log message, someone might notice and understand the
                        change. You never know who is watching your repository and why they
                        might be interested. Turning off commit emails wouldn't help; first
                        of all, the gap in the commit mail sequence would itself look
                        suspicious, and anyway, the data would still be in the repository.
                        Just do all development in some private place known only to the people
                        already aware of the bug.</p></div>

                    <p>If your vulnerability meets the criteria, you may wish to obtain
                        a CVE number for it. You can request one using the instructions at
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html" target="_top">cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html</a>,
                        but if there is someone in
                        your project who has already obtained CVE numbers, or who knows
                        someone who has, let them do it. The CVE Editorial Board gets a lot of
                        submissions, many of them spurious or poorly written submissions; by
                        approaching them through a trusted source, you are saving them time
                        and possibly getting your CVE number assigned more quickly. The other
                        advantage of doing it this way is that somewhere along the chain,
                        someone may know enough to tell you that a) it wouldn't count as a
                        vulnerability or exposure according to MITRE's criteria, so there is
                        no point submitting it, or b) the vulnerability already
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> a CVE number. The latter can happen if the
                        bug has already been published on another security advisory list, for
                        example at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cert.org/" target="_top">www.cert.org</a> or
                        on the BugTraq mailing list at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/"
                                                          target="_top">www.securityfocus.com</a>.
                        (If that happened without your project hearing about it, then you
                        should worry what else might be going on that you don't know
                        about.)</p>

                    <p>If you get a CVE number at all, you usually want to get it in
                        the early stages of your bug investigation, so that all further
                        communications can refer to that number. CVE entries are embargoed
                        until the go-public date: the number will be reserved, but MITRE will
                        allow some time (within reason) before revealing information about the
                        vulnerability&nbsp;â&nbsp;so make sure you or your intermediary
                        communicate clearly with the CVE Editorial Board about how long you
                        need before publicly announcing.</p>

                        with a particular report) has a fix ready, you need to decide how to
                        distribute it.</p>

                    <p>If you simply commit the fix to your repository, or otherwise
                        announce it to the world, you effectively force everyone using your
                        software to upgrade immediately or risk being hacked. It is sometimes
                        appropriate, therefore, to do <em class="firstterm">pre-notification</em>
                        for certain important users. This is particularly true with
                        client/server software, where there may be well-known services using
                        your software and who are tempting targets for attackers. Those
                        service's administrators would appreciate having an extra day or two
                        to do the upgrade, so that they are already protected by the time the
                        exploit becomes public knowledge.</p>

                    <p>Pre-notification simply means sending mails to those
                        administrators before the go-public date, telling them of the
                        vulnerability and how to fix it. You should send pre-notification
                        only to people you trust to be discreet with the information, and with
                        whom you can communicate securely. That is, the qualification for
                        receiving pre-notification is threefold: the recipient must run a
                        large, important service where a compromise would be a serious matter;
                        the recipient must be known to be someone who won't blab about the
                        security problem before the go-public date; and you must have a way
                        (such as via <a class="ulink" href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_top">GnuPG</a>-encrypted
                        email) to communicate securely with the recipient, so that any
                        eavesdroppers between you and your recipient can't read the
                        message.<sup>[<a name="idp8128448" href="#ftn.idp8128448" class="footnote">51</a>]</sup></p>

                    <p>Send each pre-notification mail individually (one at a time) to
                        each recipient. Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send to the entire list
                        of recipients at once, because then they would see each others'
                        namesâmeaning that you would essentially be alerting each
                        recipient to the fact that each <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> recipient
                        may have a security hole in her service. Sending it to them all via
                        blind CC (BCC) isn't a good solution either, because some admins
                        protect their inboxes with spam filters that either block or reduce
                        the priority of BCC'd mail, since so much spam is sent via BCC. If
                        you have a phone number or other out-of-band way to contact the
                        administrator to let them know the mail is coming, use it.</p>

To: admin@large-famous-server.com
Reply-to: Your Name Here (not the security list's address)
Subject: Confidential vulnerability notification.

[[[ BEGIN ENCRYPTED MAIL ]]]

This email is a confidential pre-notification of a security alert
in the Scanley server software.

Please *do not forward* any part of this mail to anyone.  The public
announcement is not until May 19th, and we'd like to keep the
information embargoed until then.

You are receiving this mail because (we think) you run a Scanley
server, and would want to have it patched before this security hole is
made public on May 19th.

References:
===========

   CVE-2015-892346: Scanley stack overflow in queries

Vulnerability:
==============

   The server can be made to run arbitrary commands if the server's
   locale is misconfigured and the client sends a malformed query.

Severity:
=========

   Very severe; can involve arbitrary code execution on the server.

Workarounds:
============

   Setting the 'natural-language-processing' option to 'off' in
   scanley.conf closes this vulnerability.

Patch:
======

   The patch below applies to Scanley 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.

   A new public release (Scanley 3.2.1) will be made on or just before
   May 19th, so that it is available at the same time as this
   vulnerability is made public.  You can patch now, or just wait for
   the public release.  The only difference between 3.2 and 3.2.1 will
   be this patch.

                    <p>If you have a CVE number, include it in the pre-notification (as
                        shown above), even though the information is still embargoed and
                        therefore the corresponding MITRE page will show nothing at the time
                        of pre-notification. Including the CVE number allows the recipient to
                        know with certainty that the bug they were pre-notified about is the
                        same one they later hear about through public channels, so they don't
                        have to worry whether further action is necessary or not, which is
                        precisely the point of CVE numbers.</p></div>

                        describe the problem, give the CVE number if any, describe how to
                        work around it, and how to permanently fix it. Usually "fix" means
                        upgrading to a new version of the software, though sometimes it can
                        mean applying a patch, particularly if the software is normally run in
                        source form anyway. If you do make a new release, it should differ
                        from some existing release by exactly the security patch. That way,
                        conservative admins can upgrade without worrying about what else they
                        might be affecting; they also don't have to worry about future upgrades,
                        because the security fix will be in all future releases as a matter of
                        course. (Details of release procedures are discussed in
                        <a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called âSecurity
                            Releasesâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Chapter&nbsp;7,
    <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>.)</p>

                    <p>Whether or not the public fix involves a new release, do the
                        announcement with roughly the same priority as you would a new
                        release: send a mail to the project's <code class="literal">announce</code>
                        list, make a new press release, etc. While you should never try to
                        play down the existence of a security bug out of concern for the
                        project's reputation, you may certainly set the tone and prominence of
                        a security announcement to match the actual severity of the problem.
                        If the security hole is just a minor information exposure, not an
                        exploit that allows the user's entire computer to be taken over, then
                        it may not warrant a lot of fuss. You may even decide not to distract
                        the <code class="literal">announce</code> list with it. After all, if the
                        project cries wolf every time, users might end up thinking the
                        software is less secure than it actually is, and also might not
                        believe you when you have a really big problem to announce. See

                    <p>In general, if you're unsure how to treat a security problem,
                        find someone with experience and talk to them about it. Assessing and
                        handling vulnerabilities is very much an acquired skill, and it's easy
                        to make missteps the first few times.</p></div>

            <p>This chapter is about how free software projects package and
                release their software, and how overall development patterns organize
                around those goals.</p>

            <p>A major difference between open source projects and proprietary
                ones is the lack of centralized control over the development team.
                When a new release is being prepared, this difference is especially
                stark: a corporation can ask its entire development team to focus on
                an upcoming release, putting aside new feature development and
                non-critical bug fixing until the release is done. Volunteer groups
                are not so monolithic. People work on the project for all sorts of
                reasons, and those not interested in helping with a given release
                still want to continue regular development work while the release is
                going on. Because development doesn't stop, open source release
                processes tend to take longer, but be less disruptive, than commercial
                release processes. It's a bit like highway repair. There are two
                ways to fix a road: you can shut it down completely, so that a repair
                crew can swarm all over it at full capacity until the problem is
                solved, or you can work on a couple of lanes at a time, while leaving the
                others open to traffic. The first way is very efficient <span class="emphasis"><em>for
                    the repair crew</em></span>, but not for anyone elseâthe road is
                entirely shut down until the job is done. The second way involves
                much more time and trouble for the repair crew (now they have to work
                with fewer people and less equipment, in cramped conditions, with
                flaggers to slow and direct traffic, etc.), but at least the road
                remains useable, albeit not at full capacity.</p>

            <p>Open source projects tend to work the second way. In fact, for
                a mature piece of software with several different release lines being
                maintained simultaneously, the project is sort of in a permanent state
                of minor road repair. There are always a couple of lanes closed; a
                consistent but low level of background inconvenience is always being
                tolerated by the development group as a whole, so that releases get
                made on a regular schedule.</p>

            <p>The model that makes this possible generalizes to more than just
                releases. It's the principle of parallelizing tasks that are not
                mutually interdependentâa principle that is by no means unique
                to open source development, of course, but one which open source
                projects implement in their own particular way. They cannot afford to
                annoy either the roadwork crew or the regular traffic too much, but
                they also cannot afford to have people dedicated to standing by the
                orange cones and flagging traffic along. Thus they gravitate toward
                processes that have flat, constant levels of administrative overhead,
                rather than peaks and valleys. Volunteers are generally willing to
                work with small but consistent amounts of inconvenience; the
                predictability allows them to come and go without worrying about
                whether their schedule will clash with what's happening in the
                project. But if the project were subject to a master schedule in
                which some activities excluded other activities, the result would be a
                lot of developers sitting idle a lot of the timeâwhich would be
                not only inefficient but boring, and therefore dangerous, in that a
                bored developer is likely to soon be an ex-developer.</p>

            <p>Release work is usually the most noticeable non-development task
                that happens in parallel with development, so the methods described in
                the following sections are geared mostly toward enabling releases.
                However, note that they also apply to other parallelizable tasks, such
                as translations and internationalization, broad API changes made
                gradually across the entire code base, etc.</p></div>

            <div class="itemizedlist">
                <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Some old bugs have been fixed. This is probably the one
                        thing users can count on being true of every release.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>New bugs have been added. This too can usually
                        be counted on, except sometimes in the case of security
                        releases or other one-offs (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called âSecurity
                            Releasesâ</a><span> later in this chapter</span>).</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>New features may have been added.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>New configuration options may have been added, or
                        the meanings of old options may have changed subtly. The
                        installation procedures may have changed slightly since
                        the last release too, though one always hopes not.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Incompatible changes may have been introduced, for
                        example such
                        that the data formats used by older versions of the
                        software are no longer useable without undergoing some
                        sort of (possibly manual) one-way conversion step.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>As you can see, not all of these are good things. This is why
                experienced users approach new releases with some trepidation,
                especially when the software is mature and was already mostly doing
                what they wanted (or thought they wanted). Even the arrival of new
                features is a mixed blessing, in that it may mean the software
                will now behave in unexpected ways.</p>

            <p>The purpose of release numbering, therefore, is twofold:
                obviously the numbers should unambiguously communicate the ordering of
                releases (i.e., by looking at any two releases' numbers, one can know
                which came later), but also they should indicate as compactly as
                possible the degree and nature of the changes in the release.</p>

            <p>All that in a number? Well, more or less, yes. Release
                numbering strategies are one of the oldest bikeshed discussions around
                (see <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">the section
                    called âThe Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debateâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>),
                and the world is
                unlikely to settle on a single, complete standard anytime soon.
                However, a few good strategies have emerged, along with one
                universally agreed-on principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>be consistent</em></span>.
                Pick a numbering scheme, document it, and stick with it. Your users
                will thank you.</p>

                <p>This section describes the formal conventions of release
                    numbering in detail, and assumes very little prior knowledge. It is
                    intended mainly as a reference. If you're already familiar with these
                    conventions, you can skip this section.</p>

                <p>Release numbers are groups of digits separated by dots:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley&nbsp;2.3<br>
                        Singer&nbsp;5.11.4</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>...and so on. The dots are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> decimal
                    points, they are merely separators; "5.3.9" would be followed by
                    "5.3.10". A few projects have occasionally hinted otherwise, most
                    famously the Linux kernel with its "0.95", "0.96"... "0.99" sequence
                    leading up to Linux 1.0, but the convention that the dots are not
                    decimals is now firmly established and should be considered a
                    standard. There is no limit to the number of components (digit
                    portions containing no dots), but most projects do not go beyond three
                    or four. The reasons why will become clear later.</p>

                <p>In addition to the numeric components, projects sometimes tack
                    on a descriptive label such as "Alpha" or "Beta" (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#alpha-and-beta" title="Alpha and Beta">Alpha and Beta</a>), for example:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha)<br>
                        Singer&nbsp;5.11.4&nbsp;(Beta)</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>An Alpha or Beta qualifier means that this
                    release <span class="emphasis"><em>precedes</em></span> a future release that will have
                    the same number without the qualifier. Thus, "2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha)"
                    leads eventually to "2.3.0". In order to allow several such candidate
                    releases in a row, the qualifiers themselves can have meta-qualifiers.
                    For example, here is a series of releases in the order that they would
                    be made available to the public:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha&nbsp;1)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Alpha&nbsp;2)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Beta&nbsp;1)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Beta&nbsp;2)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(Beta&nbsp;3)<br>
                        Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>Notice that when it has the "Alpha" qualifier, Scanley "2.3" is
                    written as "2.3.0". The two numbers are equivalentâtrailing
                    all-zero components can always be dropped for brevityâbut when a
                    qualifier is present, brevity is out the window anyway, so one might
                    as well go for completeness instead.</p>

                <p>Other qualifiers in semi-regular use include "Stable",
                    "Unstable", "Development", and "RC" (for "Release Candidate"). The
                    most widely used ones are still "Alpha" and "Beta", with "RC" running
                    a close third place, but note that "RC" always includes a numeric
                    meta-qualifier. That is, you don't release
                    "Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(RC)", you release
                    "Scanley&nbsp;2.3.0&nbsp;(RC&nbsp;1)", followed by RC2, etc.</p>

                <p>Those three labels, "Alpha", "Beta", and "RC", are pretty widely
                    known now, and I don't recommend using any of the others, even though
                    the others might at first glance seem like better choices because they
                    are normal words, not jargon. But people who install software from
                    releases are already familiar with the big three, and there's no
                    reason to do things gratuitously differently from the way everyone
                    else does them.</p>

                <p>Although the dots in release numbers are not decimal points,
                    they do indicate place-value significance. All "0.X.Y" releases
                    precede "1.0" (which is equivalent to "1.0.0", of course). "3.14.158"
                    immediately precedes "3.14.159", and non-immediately precedes
                    "3.14.160" as well as "3.15.anything", and so.</p>

                <p>A consistent release numbering policy enables a user to look at
                    two release numbers for the same piece of software and tell, just from
                    the numbers, the important differences between those two releases. In
                    a typical three-component system, the first component is
                    the <em class="firstterm">major&nbsp;number</em>, the second is
                    the <em class="firstterm">minor&nbsp;number</em>, and the third is the
                    <em class="firstterm">micro&nbsp;number</em>. For example, release
                    "2.10.17" is the eighteenth micro release in the eleventh minor release
                    line within the second major release series<sup>[<a name="idp8514624" href="#ftn.idp8514624"
                                                                        class="footnote">52</a>]</sup>. The words "line"
                    and
                    "series" are used informally here, but they mean what one would
                    expect: a major series is simply all the releases that share the same
                    major number, and a minor series (or minor line) consists of all the releases
                    that share the same minor <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> major number. That
                    is, "2.4.0" and "3.4.1" are not in the same minor series,
                    even though they both have "4" for their minor number; on the other
                    hand, "2.4.0" and "2.4.2" are in the same minor line, though they are
                    not adjacent if "2.4.1" was released between them.</p>

                <p>The meanings of these numbers themselves are also roughly what
                    you'd expect: an
                    increment of the major number indicates that major changes happened;
                    an increment of the minor number indicates minor changes; and an
                    increment of the micro number indicates really trivial changes. Some
                    projects add a fourth component, usually called
                    the <em class="firstterm">patch&nbsp;number</em>, for especially
                    fine-grained control over the differences between their releases
                    (confusingly, other projects use "patch" as a synonym for "micro" in a
                    three-component system). There are also projects that use the last
                    component as a <em class="firstterm">build&nbsp;number</em>, incremented
                    every time the software is built and representing no change other than
                    that build. This helps the project link every bug report with a
                    specific build, and is probably most useful when binary packages are
                    the default method of distribution.</p>

                <p>Although there are many different conventions for how many
                    components to use, and what the components mean, the differences tend
                    to be minorâyou get a little leeway, but not a lot. The next
                    two sections discuss some of the most widely used conventions.</p></div>

                <p>Most projects have rules about what kinds of changes are allowed
                    into a release if one is only incrementing the micro number, different
                    rules for the minor number, and still different ones for the major
                    number. There is no set standard for these rules yet, but here I will
                    describe a policy that has been used successfully by multiple
                    projects. You may want to just adopt this policy in your own
                    project, but even if you don't, it's still a good example of the kind
                    of information release numbers should convey. This policy is adapted
                    from the numbering system used by the APR project, see
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html" target="_top">apr.apache.org/versioning.html</a>.

                <p>What <em class="firstterm">backward-compatible</em>
                    and <em class="firstterm">forward-compatible</em> mean, exactly, depends on
                    what your software does, but in context they are usually not open to
                    much interpretation. For example, if your project is a client/server
                    application, then "backward-compatible" means that upgrading the
                    server to 2.6.0 should not cause any existing 2.5.4 clients to lose
                    functionality or behave differently than they did before (except for
                    bugs that were fixed, of course). On the other hand, upgrading one of
                    those clients to 2.6.0, along with the server, might
                    make <span class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> functionality available for that client,
                    functionality that 2.5.4 clients don't know how to take advantage of.
                    If that happens, then the upgrade is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
                    "forward-compatible": clearly you can't now downgrade that client
                    back to 2.5.4 and keep all the functionality it had at 2.6.0, since
                    some of that functionality was new in 2.6.0.</p>

                <p>This is why micro releases are essentially for bug fixes only.
                    They must remain compatible in both directions: if you upgrade from
                    2.5.3 to 2.5.4, then change your mind and downgrade back to 2.5.3, no
                    functionality should be lost. Of course, the bugs fixed in 2.5.4
                    would reappear after the downgrade, but you wouldn't lose any
                    features, except insofar as the restored bugs prevent the use of some
                    existing features.</p>

                <p>Client/server protocols are just one of many possible
                    compatibility domains. Another is data formats: does the software
                    write data to permanent storage? If so, the formats it reads and
                    writes need to follow the compatibility guidelines promised by the
                    release number policy. Version 2.6.0 needs to be able to read the
                    files written by 2.5.4, but may silently upgrade the format to
                    something that 2.5.4 cannot read, because the ability to downgrade is
                    not required across a minor number boundary. If your project
                    distributes code libraries for other programs to use, then APIs are a
                    compatibility domain too: you must make sure that source and binary
                    compatibility rules are spelled out in such a way that the informed
                    user need never wonder whether or not it's safe to upgrade in place.
                    She will be able to look at the numbers and know instantly.</p>

                <p>In this system, you don't get a chance for a fresh start until
                    you increment the major number. This can often be a real
                    inconvenience: there may be features you wish to add, or protocols
                    that you wish to redesign, that simply cannot be done while
                    maintaining compatibility. There's no magic solution to this, except
                    to try to design things in an extensible way in the first place (a
                    topic easily worth its own book, and certainly outside the scope of
                    this one). But publishing a release compatibility policy, and
                    adhering to it, is an inescapable part of distributing software. One
                    nasty surprise can alienate a lot of users. The policy just described
                    is good partly because it's already quite widespread, but also because
                    it's easy to explain and to remember, even for those not already familiar
                    with it.</p>

                <p>It is generally understood that these rules do not apply to
                    pre-1.0 releases (although your release policy should probably state
                    so explicitly, just to be clear). A project that is still in initial
                    development can release 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and so on in sequence, until
                    it's ready for 1.0, and the differences between those releases can be
                    arbitrarily large. Micro numbers in pre-1.0 releases are optional.
                    Depending on the nature of your project and the differences between
                    the releases, you might find it useful to have 0.1.0, 0.1.1, etc., or
                    you might not. Conventions for pre-1.0 release numbers are fairly
                    loose, mainly because people understand that strong compatibility
                    constraints would hamper early development too much, and because early
                    adopters tend to be forgiving anyway.</p>

                <p>Remember that all these injunctions only apply to this
                    particular three-component system. Your project could easily come up
                    with a different three-component system, or even decide it doesn't
                    need such fine granularity and use a two-component system instead.
                    The important thing is to decide early, publish exactly what the
                    components mean, and stick to it.</p></div>

                <p>Some projects use the parity of the minor number component to
                    indicate the stability of the software: even means stable, odd means
                    unstable. This applies only to the minor number, not the major or
                    micro numbers. Increments in the micro number still indicate bug
                    fixes (no new features), and increments in the major number still
                    indicate big changes, new feature sets, etc.</p>

                <p>The advantage of the even/odd system, which has been used by the
                    Linux kernel project among others, is that it offers a way to release
                    new functionality for testing without subjecting production users to
                    potentially unstable code. People can see from the numbers that
                    "2.4.21" is okay to install on their live web server, but that "2.5.1"
                    should probably stay confined to home workstation experiments. The
                    development team handles the bug reports that come in from the
                    unstable (odd-minor-numbered) series, and when things start to settle
                    down after some number of micro releases in that series, they
                    increment the minor number (thus making it even), reset the micro
                    number back to "0", and release a presumably stable package.</p>

                <p>This system preserves, or at least, does not conflict with, the
                    compatibility guidelines given earlier. It simply overloads the minor
                    number with some extra information. This forces the minor number to
                    be incremented about twice as often as would otherwise be necessary,
                    but there's no real harm in that. The even/odd system is probably
                    best for projects that have very long release cycles, and which by
                    their nature have a high proportion of conservative users who value
                    stability above new features. It is not the only way to get new
                    functionality tested in the wild, however. In
                    <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">the section called
                        âStabilizing a Releaseâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span> we will examine another, perhaps more common,
                    method of releasing potentially unstable code to the public, in which
                    the release number is further marked so that people have an idea of
                    the risk/benefit trade-offs immediately on seeing the release's name.</p></div>

            <p>From a developer's point of view, a free software project is in
                a state of continuous release. Developers usually run the latest
                available code at all times, because they want to spot bugs, and
                because they follow the project closely enough to be able to stay away
                from currently unstable areas of the feature space. They often update
                their copy of the software every day, sometimes more than once a day,
                and when they check in a change, they can reasonably expect that every
                other developer will have it within a day or two.</p>

            <p>How, then, should the project make a formal release? Should it
                simply take a snapshot of the tree at a moment in time, package it up,
                and hand it to the world as, say, version "3.5.0"? Common sense says
                no. First, there may be no moment in time when the entire development
                tree is clean and ready for release. Newly-started features could be
                lying around in various states of completion. Someone might have
                checked in a major change to fix a bug, but the change could be
                controversial and under debate at the moment the snapshot is taken.
                If so, it wouldn't work to simply delay the snapshot until the debate
                ends, because another, unrelated debate could start in the meantime,
                and then you'd have wait for <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> one to end too.
                This process is not guaranteed to halt.</p>

            <p>In any case, using full-tree snapshots for releases would
                interfere with ongoing development work, even if the tree could be put
                into a releasable state. Say this snapshot is going to be "3.5.0";
                presumably, the next snapshot would be "3.5.1", and would contain
                mostly fixes for bugs found in the 3.5.0 release. But if both are
                snapshots from the same tree, what are the developers supposed to do
                in the time between the two releases? They can't be adding new
                features; the compatibility guidelines prevent that. But not everyone
                will be enthusiastic about fixing bugs in the 3.5.0 code. Some people
                may have new features they're trying to complete, and will become
                irate if they are forced to choose between sitting idle and working on
                things they're not interested in, just because the project's release
                processes demand that the development tree remain unnaturally
                quiescent.</p>

            <p>The solution to these problems is to always use
                a <em class="firstterm">release branch</em>. A release branch is just a
                branch in the version control system (see
                <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-branch"><em class="firstterm">branch</em></a>), on which the code
                destined for this release can be isolated from mainline development.
                The concept of release branches is certainly not original to free
                software; many proprietary development organizations use them too.
                However, in closed-source environments, release branches are sometimes
                considered a luxuryâa kind of theoretical "best practice" that can,
                in the heat of a major deadline, be dispensed with while everyone on
                the team scrambles to stabilize the main tree.</p>

            <p>Release branches are pretty much required in open source
                projects, however. I have seen projects do releases without them, but
                it has always resulted in some developers sitting idle while
                othersâusually a minorityâwork on getting the release out
                the door. The result is usually bad in several ways. First, overall
                development momentum is slowed. Second, the release is of poorer
                quality than it needed to be, because there were only a few people
                working on it, and they were hurrying to finish so everyone else could
                get back to work. Third, it divides the development team
                psychologically, by setting up a situation in which different types of
                work interfere with each other unnecessarily. The developers sitting
                idle would probably be happy to contribute <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span>
                of their attention to a release branch, as long as that were a choice
                they could make according to their own schedules and interests. But
                without the branch, their choice becomes "Do I participate in the
                project today or not?" instead of "Do I work on the release today, or
                work on that new feature I've been developing in the mainline
                code?"</p>

                </div>
                <p>The exact mechanics of creating a release branch depend on your
                    version control system, of course, but the general concepts are the
                    same in most systems. A branch usually sprouts from another branch or
                    from the trunk. Traditionally, the trunk is where mainline
                    development goes on, unfettered by release constraints, and, say, the
                    first release branch, the one leading to the "1.0" release, sprouts
                    off the trunk. (The details of how to create and manage branches in
                    your particular version control system are beyond the scope of this
                    book, but the semantics are roughly the same everywhere.) Note that
                    you might want to name the branch "1.0.x" (with a literal "x") instead
                    of "1.0.0". That way you can use the same minor lineâi.e., the
                    same branchâfor all the micro releases in that line.</p>

                <p>The social and technical process of stabilizing the branch for
                    release is covered in <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">the
                        section called âStabilizing a Releaseâ</a><span> later in this chapter</span>. Here we are
                    concerned just with the high-level version control actions that relate
                    tothe release process. When the release branch is stabilized and
                    ready, it is time to tag a snapshot from the branch (see <a class="xref"
                                                                                href="#vc-vocabulary-tag"><em
                            class="firstterm">tag</em>&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>&nbsp;<em
                            class="firstterm">snapshot</em></a><span>in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                                                           title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                        <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) with a name like, e.g.,
                    "1.0.0". The resultant tag represents the exact state of the
                    project's source tree in the 1.0.0 release (this is useful when
                    developers need to compare against an old version while tracking down
                    a bug). The next micro release in the same line is likewise prepared
                    on the 1.0.x branch, and when it is ready, a tag is made for 1.0.1.
                    Lather, rinse, repeat for 1.0.2, and so on. When it's time to start
                    thinking about a 1.1.x release, make a new branch from trunk.</p>

                <p>Maintenance can continue in parallel along both 1.0.x and 1.1.x,
                    and releases can be made independently from both lines (while regular
                    development work happens, as always, on the main
                    trunk&nbsp;â&nbsp;in Git, the "master" branch). In fact, it is
                    not unusual to publish near-simultaneous releases from two different
                    lines. The older series is recommended for more conservative site
                    administrators, who may not want to make the big jump to (say) 1.1
                    without careful preparation. Meanwhile, more adventurous people
                    usually take the most recent release on the highest line, to make sure
                    they're getting the latest features, even at the risk of greater
                    instability.</p></div>
            <p>This is not the only release branch strategy, of course. In
                some circumstances it may not even be the best, though it's worked out
                pretty well for projects I've been involved in. Use any strategy that
                seems to work, but remember the main points: the purpose of a release
                branch is to isolate release work from the fluctuations of daily
                development, and to give the project a physical entityâthe
                release branchâaround which to organize its release process.
                That process is described in detail in the next section.</p></div>

            <p><em class="firstterm">Stabilization</em> is the process of getting a
                release branch into a releasable state; that is, of deciding which
                changes will be in the release, which will not, and shaping the branch
                content accordingly.</p>

            <p>There's a lot of potential grief contained in the word "deciding".
                The last-minute feature rush is a familiar phenomenon in
                collaborative software projects: as soon as developers see that a
                release is about to happen, they scramble to finish their current
                changes, in order not to miss the boat. This, of course, is the exact
                opposite of what you want at release time. It would be much better
                for people to work on features at a comfortable pace, and not worry
                too much about whether their changes make it into this release or the
                next one. The more changes one tries to cram into a release at the
                last minute, the more the code is destabilized, and (usually) the more
                new bugs are created.</p>

            <p>Most software engineers agree in theory on rough criteria for
                what changes should be allowed into a release line during its
                stabilization period. Obviously, fixes for severe bugs can go in,
                especially for bugs without workarounds. Documentation updates are
                fine, as are fixes to error messages (except when they are considered
                part of the interface and must remain stable). Many projects also
                allow certain kinds of low-risk or non-core changes to go in during
                stabilization, and may have formal guidelines for measuring risk. But
                no amount of formalization can obviate the need for human judgement.
                There will always be cases where the project simply has to make a
                decision about whether a given change can go into a release. The
                danger is that since each person wants to see their own favorite
                changes admitted into the release, then there will be plenty of people
                motivated to allow changes, and not enough people motivated to bar
                them.</p>

            <p>Thus, the process of stabilizing a release is mostly about
                creating mechanisms for saying "no". The trick for open source
                projects, in particular, is to come up with ways of saying "no" that
                won't result in too many hurt feelings or disappointed developers, and
                also won't prevent deserving changes from getting into the release.
                There are many different ways to do this. It's pretty easy to design
                systems that satisfy these criteria, once the team has focused on them
                as the important criteria. Here I'll briefly describe two of the most
                popular systems, at the extreme ends of the spectrum, but don't let
                that discourage your project from being creative. Plenty of other
                arrangements are possible; these are just two that I've seen work in
                practice.</p>

                <p>The group agrees to let one person be the <em class="firstterm">release
                    owner</em>. This person has final say over what changes make
                    it into the release. Of course, it is normal and expected for there
                    to be discussions and arguments, but in the end the group must grant
                    the release owner sufficient authority to make final decisions. For
                    this system to work, it is necessary to choose someone with the
                    technical competence to understand all the changes, and the social
                    standing and people skills to navigate the discussions leading up to
                    the release without causing too many hurt feelings.</p>

                <p>A common pattern is for the release owner to say "I don't think
                    there's anything wrong with this change, but we haven't had enough
                    time to test it yet, so it shouldn't go into this release." It helps
                    a lot if the release owner has broad technical knowledge of the
                    project, and can give reasons why the change could be potentially
                    destabilizing (for example, its interactions with other parts of the
                    software, or portability concerns). People will sometimes ask such
                    decisions to be justified, or will argue that a change is not as risky
                    as it looks. These conversations need not be confrontational, as long
                    as the release owner is able to consider all the arguments objectively
                    and not reflexively dig in her heels.</p>

                <p>Note that the release owner need not be the same person as the
                    project leader (in cases where there is a project leader at all; see
                    <a class="xref" href="#benevolent-dictator" title="Benevolent Dictators">the section called
                        âBenevolent Dictatorsâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                        <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>). In fact,
                    sometimes it's
                    good to make sure they're <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the same person.
                    The skills that make a good development leader are not necessarily the
                    same as those that make a good release owner. In something as
                    important as the release process, it may be wise to have someone
                    provide a counterbalance to the project leader's judgement. In that
                    case, the project leader needs to remember that overriding a decision
                    by the release owner will undermine the release owner's authority;
                    that alone may be enough reason, in most situations, to let the
                    release owner win when there is a disagreement.</p>

                <p>Contrast the release owner role with the less dictatorial role

                <p>At the opposite extreme from dictatorship by release owner,
                    developers can simply vote on which changes to include in the release.
                    However, since the most important function of release stabilization is
                    to <span class="emphasis"><em>exclude</em></span> changes, it's important to design the
                    voting system in such a way that getting a change into the release
                    involves positive action by multiple developers. Including a change
                    should need more than just a simple majority (see <a class="xref" href="#electorate"
                                                                         title="Who Votes?">the section called âWho
                        Votes?â</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>). Otherwise,
                    one vote for and none against a given change would suffice to get it
                    into the release, and an
                    unfortunate dynamic would be set up whereby each developer would vote
                    for her own changes, yet would be reluctant to vote against others'
                    changes, for fear of possible retaliation. To avoid this, the system
                    should be arranged such that subgroups of developers must act in
                    cooperation to get any change into the release. This not only means
                    that more people review each change, it also makes any individual
                    developer less hesitant to vote against a change, because she knows
                    that no particular one among those who voted for it would take her
                    vote against as a personal affront. The greater the number of people
                    involved, the more the discussion becomes about the change and less
                    about the individuals.</p>

                <p>The system used for many years in the Subversion project seems
                    to have struck
                    a good balance, so I'll recommend it here. In order for a change to
                    be applied to the release branch, at least three developers must vote
                    in favor of it, and none against. A single "no" vote is enough to
                    stop the change from being included; that is, a "no" vote in a release
                    context is equivalent to a veto (see <a class="xref" href="#veto" title="Vetoes">the section called
                        âVetoesâ</a>).
                    Naturally, any such vote must be accompanied by a justification, and
                    in theory the veto could be overridden if enough people feel it is
                    unreasonable and force a special vote over it. In practice, this
                    never happens. People are
                    conservative around releases anyway, and when someone feels strongly
                    enough to veto the inclusion of a change, there's usually a good
                    reason for it.</p>

                <p>Because the release procedure is deliberately biased toward
                    conservatism, the justifications offered for vetoes are sometimes
                    procedural rather than technical. For example, a person may feel that
                    a change is well-written and unlikely to cause any new bugs, but vote
                    against its inclusion in a micro release simply because it's too
                    bigâperhaps it adds a new feature, or in some subtle way fails
                    to fully follow the compatibility guidelines. I've occasionally even
                    seen developers veto something because they simply had a gut feeling
                    that the change needed more testing, even though they couldn't spot
                    any bugs in it by inspection. People grumbled a little bit, but the
                    vetoes stood and the change was not included in the release (I don't
                    remember if any bugs were found in later testing or not,
                    though).</p>

                    <p>If your project chooses a change voting system, it is imperative
                        that the physical mechanics of setting up ballots and casting votes be
                        as convenient as possible. Although there is plenty of open source
                        electronic voting software available, in practice the easiest thing to
                        do is just to set up a text file in the release branch,
                        called <code class="filename">STATUS</code> or <code class="filename">VOTES</code> or
                        something like that. This file lists each proposed changeâany
                        developer can propose a change for inclusionâalong with all the
                        votes for and against it, plus any notes or comments. (Proposing a
                        change doesn't necessarily mean voting for it, by the way, although
                        the two often go together.) An entry in such a file might look like
                        this:</p><pre class="screen">* commit b31910a7180fc (issue #49)
  Prevent client/server handshake from happening twice.
  Justification:
    Avoids extra network turnaround; small change and easy to review.
  Notes:
    This was discussed in http://.../mailing-lists/message-7777.html
    and other messages in that thread.
  Votes:
    +1: jsmith, kimf
    -1: tmartin (breaks compatibility with some pre-1.0 servers;
                 admittedly, those servers are buggy, but why be
                 incompatible if we don't have to?)
</pre>
                    <p>In this case, the change acquired two positive votes, but was
                        vetoed by tmartin, who gave the reason for the veto in a parenthetical
                        note. The exact format of the entry doesn't matter; whatever your
                        project settles on is fineâperhaps tmartin's explanation for the
                        veto should go up in the "Notes:" section, or perhaps the change
                        description should get a "Description:" header to match the other
                        sections. The important thing is that all the information needed to
                        evaluate the change be easily accessible, and that the mechanism for casting
                        votes be as lightweight as possible. The proposed change is referred
                        to by its revision number in the repository (in the above case a single
                        commit, b31910a7180fc, although a proposed change could just as easily
                        consist of multiple commits). The revision is assumed to refer to a
                        change made on the trunk; if the change were already on the release
                        branch, there would be no need to vote on it. If your version control
                        system doesn't have an obvious syntax for referring to individual
                        changes, then the project should make one up. For voting to be
                        practical, each change under consideration must be unambiguously
                        identifiable.<sup>[<a name="idp8593920" href="#ftn.idp8593920" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>Those proposing or voting for a change are responsible for
                        making sure it applies cleanly to the release branch, that is, applies
                        without conflicts (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-conflict"><em class="firstterm">conflict</em></a>).
                        If there are conflicts, then the entry should either point to an
                        adjusted patch that does apply cleanly, or better yet to a temporary
                        branch that holds an adjusted version of the change, for example:</p><pre class="screen">* r13222, r13223, r13232

                    <p>That example is taken from real life; it comes from the
                        <code class="filename">STATUS</code> file for the Subversion 1.1.4 release
                        process. Notice how it uses the original revisions as canonical
                        handles on the change, even though there is also a branch with a
                        conflict-adjusted version of the change (the branch also combines the
                        three trunk revisions into one, r13517, to make it easier to merge the
                        change into the release, should it get approval). The original
                        revisions are provided because they're still the easiest entity to
                        review, since they have the original log messages. The temporary
                        branch wouldn't have those log messages; in order to avoid duplication
                        of information (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#vc-singularity" title="Singularity of information">the section called

                        branch's log message for r13517 should simply say "Adjust r13222,
                        r13223, and r13232 for backport to 1.1.x branch." All other
                        information about the changes can be chased down at their original
                        revisions.</p></div>

                        changes into the
                        release branch can be performed by any developer. There does not need
                        to be one person whose job it is to merge changes; if there are a lot
                        of changes, it can be better to spread the burden around.</p>

                    <p>However, although both voting and merging happen in a
                        decentralized fashion, in practice there are usually one or two people
                        driving the release process. This role is sometimes formally blessed
                        as <em class="firstterm">release manager</em>, but it is quite different
                        from a release owner (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#release-owner" title="Dictatorship by Release Owner">the section called
                            âDictatorship by Release Ownerâ</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>) who has
                        final say over the changes. Release managers keep track of how many
                        changes are currently under consideration, how many have been
                        approved, how many seem likely to be approved, etc. If they sense
                        that important changes are not getting enough attention, and might be
                        left out of the release for lack of votes, they will gently nag other
                        developers to review and vote. When a batch of changes are approved,
                        these people will often take it upon themselves to merge them into the
                        release branch; it's fine if others leave that task to them, as
                        long as everyone understands that the release managers are not
                        obligated to do all the
                        work unless they have explicitly committed to it. When the time comes
                        to put the release out the door (see

            <p>The canonical form for distribution of free software is as
                source code. This is true regardless of whether the software normally
                runs in source form (i.e., can be interpreted, like Perl, Python, PHP,
                etc.) or needs to be compiled first (like C, C++, Java, etc.). With
                compiled software, most users will probably not compile the sources
                themselves, but will instead install from pre-built binary packages
                (see <a class="xref" href="#binary-packages" title="Binary Packages">the section called âBinary
                    Packagesâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>). However, those binary
                packages are still derived from a master source distribution. The
                point of the source package is to unambiguously define the release.
                When the project distributes "Scanley&nbsp;2.5.0", what it means,
                specifically, is "The tree of source code files that, when compiled
                (if necessary) and installed, produces Scanley 2.5.0."</p>

            <p>There is a fairly strict standard for how source releases
                should look. One will occasionally see deviations from this standard,
                but they are the exception, not the rule. Unless there is a compelling
                reason to do otherwise, your project should follow this standard
                too.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Format">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="packaging-format"></a>Format</h3></div>

                </div>
                <a name="packaging-tar"></a>

                <p>The source code should be shipped in the standard formats for
                    transporting directory trees. For Unix and Unix-like operating
                    systems, the convention is to use TAR format, compressed
                    by <span class="command"><strong>compress</strong></span>, <span
                            class="command"><strong>gzip</strong></span>,
                    <span class="command"><strong>bzip</strong></span> or <span
                            class="command"><strong>bzip2</strong></span>. For MS Windows,
                    the standard method for distributing directory trees
                    is <em class="firstterm">zip</em> format, which compresses
                    automatically. For JavaScript projects, it is customary to ship the
                    "minified"<sup>[<a name="idp8622800" href="#ftn.idp8622800" class="footnote">54</a>]</sup>
                    versions of the files together with the human-readable source files.</p></div>

                <a name="changelog"></a>

                <p>The name of the package should consist of the software's name
                    plus the release number, plus the format suffixes appropriate for the
                    archive type. For example, Scanley 2.5.0, packaged for Unix using GNU
                    Zip (gzip) compression, would look like this:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>or for Windows using zip compression:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.zip</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>Either of these archives, when unpacked, should create a single
                    new directory tree named <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code> in the
                    current directory. Underneath the new directory, the source code
                    should be arranged in a layout ready for compilation (if compilation
                    is needed) and installation. In the top level of new directory tree,
                    there should be a plain text <code class="filename">README</code> file
                    explaining what the software does and what release this is, and giving
                    pointers to other resources, such as the project's web site, other
                    files of interest, etc. Among those other files should be an
                    <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file, sibling to
                    the <code class="filename">README</code> file, giving instructions on how to build
                    and install the software for all the operating systems it supports.

                <p>There should also be a <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file
                    (sometimes called <code class="filename">NEWS</code>), explaining what's new in
                    this release. The <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file accumulates
                    changelists for all releases, in reverse chronological order, so that
                    the list for this release appears at the top of the file. Completing
                    that list is usually the last thing done on a stabilizing release
                    branch; some projects write the list piecemeal as they're developing,
                    others prefer to save it all up for the end and have one person write
                    it, getting information by combing the version control logs. The list
                    looks something like this:</p><pre class="screen">Version 2.5.0
(20 December 2014, from branches 2.5.x)
http://scanley.org/repos/tags/2.5.0/

 New features, enhancements:
    * Added regular expression queries (issue #53)
    * Added support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 documents
    * Documentation translated into Polish, Russian, Malagasy
    * ...

 Bugfixes:
    * fixed reindexing bug (issue #945)
    * fixed some query bugs (issues #815, #1007, #1008)
    * ...
</pre>
                <p>The list can be as long as necessary, but don't bother to
                    include every little bugfix and feature enhancement. Its purpose is
                    to give users an overview of what they would gain by upgrading to
                    the new release, and to tell them about any incompatible changes. In
                    fact, the changelist is customarily included in the announcement email
                    (see <a class="xref" href="#testing-and-releasing" title="Testing and Releasing">the section called
                        âTesting and Releasingâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so write it with that
                    audience in mind.</p>

                <p>The actual layout of the source code inside the tree should be
                    the same as, or as similar as possible to, the source code layout one
                    would get by checking out the project directly from its version
                    control repository. Sometimes there are a few differences, for example
                    because the package contains some generated files needed for
                    configuration and compilation (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#packaging-build-install" title="Compilation and Installation">the section
                        called âCompilation and Installationâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), or because the distribution includes
                    third-party software that is not maintained by the project, but that
                    is required and that users are not likely to already have. But even
                    if the distributed tree corresponds exactly to some development tree
                    in the version control repository, the distribution itself should not
                    be a working copy (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-working-copy"><em class="firstterm">working
                        copy</em>&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>&nbsp;<em class="firstterm">working
                        files</em></a>).
                    The release is supposed to represent a static reference pointâa
                    particular, unchangeable configuration of source files. If it were a
                    working copy, the danger would be that the user might update it, and
                    afterward think that he still has the release when in fact he has
                    something different.</p>

                <p>Remember that the package is the same regardless of the
                    packaging. The releaseâthat is, the precise entity referred to
                    when someone says "Scanley&nbsp;2.5.0"âis the tree created by
                    unpacking a zip file or tarball. So the project might offer all of
                    these for download:</p>

                <div class="informalexample">
                    <div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.tar.bz2<br>
                        scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz<br>
                        scanley-2.5.0.zip</p></div>
                </div>
                <p>...but the source tree created by unpacking them would be the
                    same. That source tree itself is the distribution; the form in which it is
                    downloaded is merely a matter of convention or convenience. Certain minor
                    differences between source packages are allowable: for example, in the
                    Windows package, text files may have lines ending with CRLF
                    (Carriage Return and Line Feed), while Unix packages would use just
                    LF. The trees may be arranged slightly differently between source
                    packages destined for different operating systems, too, if those
                    operating systems require different sorts of layouts for compilation.
                    However, these are all basically trivial transformations. The basic
                    source files should be the same across all the packagings of a given
                    release.</p>

                <div class="sect3" title="To capitalize or not to capitalize">
                    <div class="titlepage">

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>When referring to a project by name, people generally capitalize
                        it as a proper noun, and capitalize acronyms if there are any:
                        "MySQL&nbsp;5.0", "Scanley&nbsp;2.5.0", etc. Whether this
                        capitalization is reproduced in the package name is up to the project.
                        Either <code class="filename">Scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> or
                        <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> would be fine, for example
                        (I personally prefer the latter, because I don't like to make people
                        hit the shift key, but plenty of projects ship capitalized packages).
                        The important thing is that the directory created by unpacking the
                        tarball use the same capitalization. There should be no surprises:
                        the user must be able to predict with perfect accuracy the name of the
                        directory that will be created when she unpacks a distribution.</p></div>

                <p>For software requiring compilation or installation from source,
                    there are usually standard procedures that experienced users expect to
                    be able to follow. For example, for programs written in C, C++, or
                    certain other compiled languages, the standard under Unix-like systems
                    is for the user to type:</p><pre class="screen">   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install
</pre>
                <p>The first command autodetects as much about the environment as
                    it can and prepares for the build process, the second command builds
                    the software in place (but does not install it), and the last command
                    installs it on the system. The first two commands are done as a
                    regular user, the third as root. For more details about setting up
                    this system, see the excellent <em class="citetitle">GNU Autoconf, Automake, and
                        Libtool</em> book by Vaughan, Elliston, Tromey, and Taylor. It
                    is published as treeware by New Riders, and its content is also freely
                    available online at
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/" target="_top">sources.redhat.com/autobook</a>.
                </p>

                <p>This is not the only standard, though it is one of the most
                    widespread. Other programming languages often have their own
                    standards for building and installing packages. If it's not obvious
                    to you what the applicable standards are for your project, ask an
                    experienced developer; you can safely assume that
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> standard applies, even if you don't know
                    what it is at first.</p>

                <p>Whatever the appropriate standards for you project are, don't
                    deviate from them unless you absolutely must. Standard installation
                    procedures are practically spinal reflexes for a lot of system
                    administrators now. If they see familiar invocations documented in
                    your project's <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file, that instantly
                    raises their faith that your project is generally aware of
                    conventions, and that it is likely to have gotten other things right
                    as well. Also, as discussed in
                    <a class="xref" href="#downloads" title="Downloads">the section called âDownloadsâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Getting Started">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Getting
    Started</i></a></span>, having a standard
                    build procedure pleases potential developers.</p>

                <p>On Windows, the standards for building and installing are a bit
                    less settled. For projects requiring compilation, the general
                    convention seems to be to ship a tree that can fit into the
                    workspace/project model of the standard Microsoft development
                    environments (Developer Studio, Visual Studio, VS.NET, MSVC++, etc.).
                    Depending on the nature of your software, it may be possible to offer
                    a Unix-like build option on Windows via the Cygwin
                    (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">cygwin.com</a>) environment.
                    And of course,
                    if you're using a language or programming framework that comes with
                    its own build and install conventionsâe.g., Perl or
                    Pythonâyou should simply use whatever the standard method is for
                    that framework, whether on Windows, Unix, Mac OS X, or any other
                    operating system.</p>

                <p>Be willing to put in a lot of extra effort in order to make your
                    project conform to the relevant build or installation standards.
                    Building and installing is an entry point: it's okay for things to get
                    harder after that, if they absolutely must, but it would be a shame
                    for the user's or developer's very first interaction with the software
                    to require unexpected steps.</p></div>

                </div>
                <p>Although the formal release is a source code package, users often
                    install software from binary packages, either provided by their operating
                    system's software distribution mechanism, or obtained manually from
                    the project web site or from some third party. Here "binary" doesn't
                    necessarily mean "compiled"; it's a general term for
                    pre-configured form of
                    the package that allows a user to install it on his computer without
                    going through the usual source-based build and install procedures. On
                    RedHat GNU/Linux, it is the RPM system; on Debian GNU/Linux, it is the
                    APT (<code class="filename">.deb</code>) system; etc.</p>

                <p>Whether these binary packages are assembled by people closely
                    associated with the project, or by distant third parties, users are
                    going to <span class="emphasis"><em>treat</em></span> them as equivalent to the
                    project's official releases, and will file tickets in the project's bug
                    tracker based on the behavior of the binary packages. Therefore, it
                    is in the project's interest to provide packagers with clear
                    guidelines, and work closely with them to see to it that what they
                    produce represents the software fairly and accurately.</p>

                <p>The main thing packagers need to know is that they should always
                    base their binary packages on an official source release. Sometimes
                    packagers are tempted to pull an unstable incarnation of the code from the
                    repository, or to include selected changes that were committed after the
                    release was made, in order to provide users with certain bug fixes or
                    other improvements. The packager thinks he is doing his users a favor
                    by giving them the more recent code, but actually this practice can
                    cause a great deal of confusion. Projects are prepared to receive
                    reports of bugs found in released versions, and bugs found in recent
                    trunk and major branch code (that is, found by people who deliberately
                    run bleeding edge code). When a bug report comes in from these
                    sources, the responder will often be able to confirm immediately that
                    the bug is
                    known to be present in that snapshot, and perhaps that it has since
                    been fixed and that the user should upgrade or wait for the
                    next release. If it is a previously unknown bug, knowing the precise
                    release makes it easier to reproduce and easier to categorize in the
                    tracker.</p>

                <p>Projects are not prepared, however, to receive bug reports based
                    on unspecified intermediate or hybrid versions. Such bugs can be hard
                    to reproduce; also, they may be due to unexpected interactions between
                    isolated changes pulled in from later development, and thereby cause
                    misbehaviors that the project's developers should not have to take the
                    blame for. I have even seen dismayingly large amounts of time wasted
                    because a bug was <span class="emphasis"><em>absent</em></span> when it should have been
                    present: someone was running a slightly patched up version, based on
                    (but not identical to) an official release, and when the predicted bug
                    did not happen, everyone had to dig around a lot to figure out
                    why.</p>

                <p>Still, there will sometimes be circumstances when a packager
                    insists that modifications to the source release are necessary<sup>[<a name="idp8681920"
                                                                                           href="#ftn.idp8681920"
                                                                                           class="footnote">56</a>]</sup>.
                    Packagers should be encouraged to bring this up with the project's
                    developers and describe their plans. They may get approval, but
                    failing that, they will at least have notified the project of their
                    intentions, so the project can watch out for unusual bug reports. The
                    developers may respond by putting a disclaimer on the project's web
                    site, and may ask that the packager do the same thing in the
                    appropriate place, so that users of that binary package know what they
                    are getting is not exactly the same as what the project officially
                    released. There need be no animosity in such a situation, though
                    unfortunately there often is. It's just that packagers have a
                    slightly different set of goals from developers. The packagers mainly
                    want the best out-of-the-box experience for their users. The
                    developers want that too, of course, but they also need to ensure that
                    they know what versions of the software are out there, so they can
                    receive coherent bug reports and make compatibility guarantees.
                    Sometimes these goals conflict. When they do, it's good to keep in
                    mind that the project has no control over the packagers, and that the
                    bonds of obligation run both ways. It's true that the project is
                    doing the packagers a favor simply by producing the software. But the
                    packagers are also doing the project a favor, by taking on a mostly
                    unglamorous job in order to make the software more widely available,
                    often by orders of magnitude. It's fine to disagree with packagers,
                    but don't flame them; just try to work things out as best you
                    can.</p></div>

            <p>Once the source distribution is produced from the stabilized release
                branch, the public part of the release process begins. But before the
                distribution is made available to the world at large, it should be tested
                and approved by some minimum number of developers, usually three or
                more. Approval is not simply a matter of inspecting the release for
                obvious flaws; ideally, the developers download the package, build and
                install it onto a clean system, run the regression test suite (see
                <a class="xref" href="#automated-testing" title="Automated testing">the section called âAutomated
                    testingâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>), and do some
                manual testing. Assuming it passes these checks, as well as any other
                release checklist criteria the project may have, the developers then
                digitally sign each container (the .tar.gz file, .zip file, etc) using
                GnuPG (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnupg.org/" target="_top">gnupg.org</a>), PGP
                (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pgpi.org/" target="_top">pgpi.org</a>), or some other
                program capable of producing PGP-compatible signatures.</p>

            <p>In most projects, the developers just use their personal digital
                signatures, instead of a shared project key, and as many developers as
                want to may sign (i.e., there is a minimum number, but not a maximum).
                The more developers sign, the more testing the release undergoes, and
                also the greater the likelihood that a security-conscious user can
                find a digital trust path from herself to the release.</p>

            <p>Once approved, the release (that is, all tarballs, zip files,
                and whatever other formats are being distributed) should be placed
                into the project's download area, accompanied by the digital
                signatures, and by MD5/SHA1 checksums (see <a class="ulink"
                                                              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"

                There are various standards for doing this. One way is to accompany
                each released package with a file giving the corresponding digital
                signatures, and another file giving the checksum. For example, if one
                of the released packages is <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code>,
                place in the same directory a file
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.asc</code> containing the digital
                signature for that tarball, another file
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.md5</code> containing its MD5
                checksum, and optionally another,
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.sha1</code>, containing the SHA1
                checksum. A different way to provide checking is to collect all the
                signatures for all the released packages into a single file,
                <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.sigs</code>; the same may be done with the
                checksums.</p>

            <p>It doesn't really matter which way you do it. Just keep to a
                simple scheme, describe it clearly, and be consistent from release to
                release. The purpose of all this signing and checksumming is to give
                users a way to verify that the copy they receive has not been
                maliciously tampered with. Users are about to run this code on their
                computersâif the code has been tampered with, an attacker could
                suddenly have a back door to all their data. See
                <a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">the section called âSecurity

                </div>
                <p>For important releases containing many changes, many projects
                    prefer to put out <em class="firstterm">release candidates</em> first,
                    e.g., <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta1</code> before
                    <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code>. The purpose of a candidate is to
                    subject the code to wide testing before blessing it as an official
                    release. If problems are found, they are fixed on the release branch
                    and a new candidate release is rolled out
                    (<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta2</code>). The cycle continues until
                    no unacceptable bugs are left, at which point the last candidate
                    release becomes the official releaseâthat is, the only
                    difference between the last candidate release and the real release
                    is the removal of the qualifier from the version number.</p>

                <p>In most other respects, a candidate release should be treated
                    the same as a real release. The <span class="emphasis"><em>alpha</em></span>,
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>beta</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>rc</em></span> qualifier
                    is
                    enough to warn conservative users to wait until the real release, and
                    of course the announcement emails for the candidate releases should
                    point out that their purpose is to solicit feedback. Other than
                    that, give candidate releases the same amount of care as regular
                    releases. After all, you want people to use the candidates, because
                    exposure is the best way to uncover bugs, and also because you never
                    know which candidate release will end up becoming the official
                    release.</p></div>

                <p>Announcing a release is like announcing any other event, and
                    should use the procedures described in
                    <a class="xref" href="#publicity" title="Publicity">the section called âPublicityâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>.
                    There are a few
                    specific things to do for releases, though.</p>

                <p>Whenever you write the URL to the downloadable release tarball,
                    make sure to also write the MD5/SHA1 checksums and pointers to the
                    digital signatures file. Since the announcement happens in multiple
                    forums (mailing list, news page, etc.), this means users can get the
                    checksums from multiple sources, which gives the most
                    security-conscious among them extra assurance that the checksums
                    themselves have not been tampered with. Meanwhile, giving the link to the
                    digital signature files multiple times doesn't make those signatures
                    more secure, but it does reassure people (especially those who don't
                    follow the project closely) that the project takes security
                    seriously.</p>

                <p>In the announcement email, and on news pages that contain more
                    than just a blurb about the release, make sure to include the relevant
                    portion of the CHANGES file, so people can see why it might be in
                    their interests to upgrade. This is as important with candidate
                    releases as with final releases; the presence of bugfixes and new
                    features is important in tempting people to try out a candidate
                    release.</p>

                <p>Finally, don't forget to thank the development team, the
                    testers, and all the people who took the time to file good bug
                    reports. Don't single out anyone by name, though, unless there's
                    someone who is individually responsible for a huge piece of work,
                    the value of which is widely recognized by everyone in the
                    project. Be wary of sliding down the slippery slope of credit
                    inflation (see <a class="xref" href="#credit" title="Credit">the section called âCreditâ</a><span>

            <p>Most mature projects maintain multiple release lines in
                parallel. For example, after 1.0.0 comes out, that line should
                continue with micro (bugfix) releases 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc., until the
                project explicitly decides to end the line. Note that merely
                releasing 1.1.0 is not sufficient reason to end the 1.0.x line. For
                example, some users make it a policy never to upgrade to the first
                release in a new minor or major seriesâthey let others shake the
                bugs out of, say 1.1.0, and wait until 1.1.1. This isn't necessarily
                selfish (remember, they're forgoing the bugfixes and new features
                too); it's just that, for whatever reason, they've decided to be very
                careful with upgrades. Accordingly, if the project learns of a major
                bug in 1.0.3 right before it's about to release 1.1.0, it would be a
                bit severe to just put the bugfix in 1.1.0 and tell all the old 1.0.x
                users they should upgrade. Why not release both 1.1.0 and 1.0.4, so
                everyone can be happy?</p>

            <p>After the 1.1.x line is well under way, you can declare 1.0.x to
                be at <em class="firstterm">end of life</em>. This should be announced
                officially. The announcement could stand alone, or it could be
                mentioned as part of a 1.1.x release announcement; however you do
                it, users need to know that the old line is being phased out, so they
                can make upgrade decisions accordingly.</p>

            <p>Some projects set a window of time during which they pledge to
                support the previous release line. In an open source context,
                "support" means accepting bug reports against that line, and making
                maintenance releases when significant bugs are found. Other projects
                don't give a definite amount of time, but watch incoming bug reports
                to gauge how many people are still using the older line. When the
                percentage drops below a certain point, they declare end of life for
                the line and stop supporting it.</p>

            <p>For each release, make sure to have a <em class="firstterm">target
                version</em> or <em class="firstterm">target milestone</em>
                available in the bug tracker, so people filing bugs will be able to do
                so against the proper release. Don't forget to also have a target
                called "development" or "latest" for the most recent development
                sources, since some peopleânot only active developersâwill
                often stay ahead of the official releases.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Most of the details of handling security bugs were covered in
                    <a class="xref" href="#security" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">the section called
                        âAnnouncing Security Vulnerabilitiesâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>,
                    but there are some
                    special details to discuss for doing security releases.</p>

                <p>A <em class="firstterm">security release</em> is a release made
                    solely to close a security vulnerability. The code that fixes the bug
                    cannot be made public until the release is available, which means not
                    only that the fixes cannot be committed to the repository until the
                    day of the release, but also that the release cannot be publicly
                    tested before it goes out the door. Obviously, the developers can
                    examine the fix among themselves, and test the release privately, but
                    widespread real-world testing is not possible.</p>

                <p>Because of this lack of testing, a security release should
                    always consist of some existing release plus the fixes for the
                    security bug, with <span class="emphasis"><em>no other changes</em></span>. This is
                    because the more changes you ship without testing, the more likely
                    that one of them will cause a new bug, perhaps even a new security
                    bug! This conservatism is also friendly to administrators who may
                    need to deploy the security fix, but whose upgrade policy stipulates
                    that they not deploy any other changes at the same time.</p>

                <p>Making a security release sometimes involves some minor
                    deception. For example, the project may have been working on a 1.1.3
                    release, with certain bug fixes to 1.1.2 already publicly declared,
                    when a security report comes in. Naturally, the developers cannot
                    talk about the security problem until they make the fix available;
                    until then, they must continue to talk publicly as though 1.1.3 will
                    be what it's always been planned to be. But when 1.1.3 actually
                    comes out, it will differ from 1.1.2 only in the security fixes, and
                    all those other fixes will have been deferred to 1.1.4 (which, of
                    course, will now <span class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> contain the security
                    fix, as will all other future releases).</p>

                <p>You could add an extra component to an existing release to
                    indicate that it contains security changes only. For example, people
                    would be able to tell just from the numbers that 1.1.2.1 is a security
                    release against 1.1.2, and they would know that any release "higher"
                    than that (e.g., 1.1.3, 1.2.0, etc.) contains the same security fixes.
                    For those in the know, this system conveys a lot of information. On
                    the other hand, for those not following the project closely, it can be
                    a bit confusing to see a three-component release number most of the
                    time with an occasional four-component one thrown in seemingly at
                    random. Most projects I've looked at choose consistency and simply
                    use the next regularly scheduled number for security releases, even
                    when it means shifting other planned releases by one number.</p></div>

            <p>Maintaining parallel releases simultaneously has implications
                for how daily development is done. In particular, it makes
                practically mandatory a discipline that would be recommended anyway:
                have each commit be a single logical change, and don't mix unrelated
                changes in the same commit. If a change is too big or too disruptive
                to do in one commit, break it across N commits, where each commit is a
                well-partitioned subset of the overall change, and includes nothing
                unrelated to the overall change.</p>

            <p>Here's an example of an ill-thought-out commit:</p><pre class="screen">commit 3b1917a01f8c50e25db0b71edce32357d2645759
Author: J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;
Date:   Sat 2014-06-28 15:53:07 -0500

Fix Issue #1729: warn on change during re-indexing.

Make indexing gracefully warn the user when a file is changing as it
is being indexed.

* ui/repl.py
  (ChangingFile): New exception class.
  (DoIndex): Handle new exception.

* indexer/index.py
  (FollowStream): Raise new exception if file changes during indexing.
  (BuildDir): Unrelatedly, remove some obsolete comments, reformat
  some code, and fix the error check when creating a directory.

Other unrelated cleanups:

* www/index.html: Fix some typos, set next release date.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
            <p>The problem with it becomes apparent as soon as someone needs to
                port the <code class="function">BuildDir</code> error check fix over to a
                branch for an upcoming maintenance release. The porter doesn't want
                any of the other changesâfor example, perhaps the fix for ticket
                #1729 wasn't approved for the maintenance branch at all, and the
                <code class="filename">index.html</code> tweaks would simply be irrelevant
                there. But she cannot easily grab just the
                <code class="function">BuildDir</code> change via the version control tool's
                merge functionality, because the version control system was told that
                that change is logically grouped with all these other unrelated
                things. In fact, the problem would become apparent even before the
                merge. Merely listing the change for voting would become problematic:
                instead of just giving the revision number, the proposer would have to
                make a special patch or change branch just to isolate the portion of
                the commit being proposed. That would be a lot of work for others to
                suffer through, and all because the original committer couldn't be
                bothered to break things into logical groups.</p>

            <p>In fact, that commit really should have been
                <span class="emphasis"><em>four</em></span> separate commits: one to fix issue
                #1729, another to remove obsolete comments and reformat code in
                <code class="function">BuildDir</code>, another to fix the error check in
                <code class="function">BuildDir</code>, and finally, one to tweak
                <code class="filename">index.html</code>. The third of those commits would be
                the one proposed for the maintenance release branch.</p>

            <p>Of course, release stabilization is not the only reason why
                having each commit be one logical change is desirable.
                Psychologically, a semantically unified commit is easier to review,
                and easier to revert if necessary (in some version control systems,
                reversion is really a special kind of merge anyway). A little
                up-front discipline on each developer's part can save the project a
                lot of headache later.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Planning Releases">
                <div class="titlepage">

                </div>
                <p>One area where open source projects have historically differed
                    from proprietary projects is in release planning. Proprietary
                    projects usually have firmer deadlines. Sometimes it's because
                    customers were promised that an upgrade would be available by a
                    certain date, because the new release needs to be coordinated with
                    some other effort for marketing purposes, or because the venture
                    capitalists who invested in the whole thing need to see some results
                    before they put in any more funding. Free software projects, on the
                    other hand, are concerned with maintaining a cooperative working
                    atmosphere among many parties, some of them possibly business
                    competitors, and the preservation of the working relationship can
                    trump and single party's deadlines.</p>

                <p>Of course, many open source projects are funded by corporations,
                    and are correspondingly by deadline-conscious management. This is in
                    many ways a good thing, but it can
                    cause conflicts between the priorities of those developers who are
                    being paid and those who are volunteering their time. These conflicts
                    often happen around the issue of when and how to schedule releases.
                    The salaried developers who are under pressure will naturally want to
                    just pick a date when the releases will occur, and have everyone's
                    activities fall into line. But the volunteers may have other
                    agendasâperhaps features they want to complete, or some testing
                    they want to have doneâthat they feel the release should wait
                    on.</p>

                <p>There is no general solution to this problem except discussion
                    and compromise, of course. But you can minimize the frequency and
                    degree of friction caused, by decoupling the proposed
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a given release from the date when
                    it would go out the door. That is, try to steer discussion toward the
                    subject of which releases the project will be making in the near- to
                    medium-term future, and what features will be in them, without at
                    first mentioning anything about dates, except for rough guesses with
                    wide margins of error<sup>[<a name="idp8748064" href="#ftn.idp8748064"
                                                  class="footnote">57</a>]</sup>.
                    By nailing down feature sets early, you reduce
                    the complexity of the discussion centered on any individual release,
                    and therefore improve predictability. This also creates a kind of
                    inertial bias against anyone who proposes to expand the definition of
                    a release by adding new features or other complications. If the
                    release's contents are fairly well defined, the onus is on the
                    proposer to justify the expansion, even though the date of the release
                    may not have been set yet.</p>

                <p>In his multi-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
                    <em class="citetitle">Jefferson and His Time</em>, Dumas Malone tells the
                    story of how Jefferson handled the first meeting held to decide the
                    organization of the future University of Virginia. The University had
                    been Jefferson's idea in the first place, but (as is the case
                    everywhere, not just in open source projects) many other parties had
                    climbed on board quickly, each with their own interests and agendas.
                    When they gathered at that first meeting to hash things out, Jefferson
                    made sure to show up with meticulously prepared architectural
                    drawings, detailed budgets for construction and operation, a proposed
                    curriculum, and the names of specific faculty he wanted to import from
                    Europe. No one else in the room was even remotely as prepared; the
                    group essentially had to capitulate to Jefferson's vision, and the
                    University was eventually founded more or less in accordance with his
                    plans. The facts that construction went far over budget, and that
                    many of his ideas did not, for various reasons, work out in the end,
                    were all things Jefferson probably knew perfectly well would happen.
                    His purpose was strategic: to show up at the meeting with something so
                    substantive that everyone else would have to fall into the role of
                    simply proposing modifications to it, so that the overall shape, and
                    therefore schedule, of the project would be roughly as he
                    wanted.</p>

                <p>In the case of a free software project, there is no single
                    "meeting", but instead a series of small proposals made in the
                    discussion forums and in the ticket tracker. But if you have some
                    credibility in the
                    project to start with, and you start assigning various features,
                    enhancements, and bugs to target releases in the tracker,
                    according to some announced overall plan, people will mostly go along
                    with you. Once you've got things laid out more or less as you want
                    them, the conversations about actual release
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>dates</em></span> will go much more smoothly.</p>

                <p>It is crucial, of course, to never present any individual
                    decision as written in stone. In the comments associated with each
                    assignment of a ticket to a specific future release, invite
                    discussion, dissent, and be genuinely willing to be persuaded whenever
                    possible. Never exercise control merely for the sake of exercising
                    control: the more deeply others feel they can participate in the
                    release planning process (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#share-management" title="Share Management Tasks as Well as Technical Tasks">the
                        section called âShare Management Tasks as Well as Technical Tasksâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Managing Volunteers">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>Managing
    Volunteers</i></a></span>), the easier it
                    will be to persuade them to share your priorities on the issues that
                    really count for you.</p>

                <p>The other way the project can lower tensions around release
                    planning is to make releases fairly often. When there's a long time
                    between releases, the importance of any individual release is
                    magnified in everyone's minds; people are that much more crushed when
                    their code doesn't make it in, because they know how long it might be
                    until the next chance. Depending on the complexity of the release
                    process and the nature of your project, somewhere between every three
                    and six months is usually about the right gap between releases, though
                    maintenance lines may put out micro releases a bit faster, if there is
                    demand for them.</p></div>

            <p>Getting people to agree on what a project needs, and to work
                together to achieve it, requires more than just a genial atmosphere
                and a lack of obvious dysfunction. It requires someone, or several
                someones, consciously managing all the people involved. Managing
                volunteers may not be a technical craft in the same sense as computer
                programming, but it is a craft in the sense that it can be improved
                through study and practice.</p>

            <p>This chapter is a grab-bag of specific techniques for managing
                volunteers. It draws, perhaps more heavily than previous chapters, on
                the Subversion project as a case study, partly because I was working
                on that project as I wrote the first edition of this book and had all
                the primary sources close
                at hand, and partly because it's more acceptable to cast critical
                stones into one's own glass house than into others'. But I have also
                seen in various other projects the benefits of applyingâand the
                consequences of not applyingâthe recommendations that follow;
                when it is politically feasible to give examples from some of those
                other projects, I will do so.</p>

            <p>Speaking of politics, this is as good a time as any to drag that
                much-maligned word out for a closer look. Many engineers like to
                think of politics as something other people engage in.
                "<span class="emphasis"><em>I'm</em></span> just advocating the best course for the
                project, but <span class="emphasis"><em>he's</em></span> raising objections for
                political reasons." I believe this distaste for politics (or for what
                is imagined to be politics) is especially strong in engineers because
                engineers are bought into the idea that some solutions are objectively
                superior to others. Thus, when someone acts in a way that seems
                motivated by outside considerationsâsay, the maintenance of his
                own position of influence, the lessening of someone else's
                influence, outright horse-trading, or avoiding hurting someone's
                feelingsâother participants in the project may get annoyed. Of
                course, this rarely prevents them from behaving in the same way when
                their own vital interests are at stake.</p>

            <p>If you consider "politics" a dirty word, and hope to keep your
                project free of it, give up right now. Politics are inevitable
                whenever people have to cooperatively manage a shared resource. In
                the case of an open source project, even though the code itself is not
                a shared resource (since it can be copied by anyone), attention,
                credibility, and influence in the project are very much shared
                resources: they are by definition not copyable, not forkable.</p>

            <p>Thus it is quite reasonable that one of the considerations
                going into each person's decision-making process is the question of
                how a given action might affect his own future influence in the
                project. After all, if you trust your own judgement and skills, as
                most programmers do, then the potential loss of future influence has
                to be considered a technical result, in a sense. Similar reasoning
                applies to other behaviors that might seem, on their face, like "pure"
                politics. In fact, there is no such thing as pure politics: it is
                precisely because actions have multiple real-world consequences that
                people become politically conscious in the first place. Politics is,
                in the end, simply an acknowledgment that <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
                consequences of decisions must be taken into account. If a particular
                decision leads to a result that most participants find technically
                satisfying, but involves a change in power relationships that leaves
                key people feeling isolated, the latter is just as important a result
                as the former. To ignore it would not be high-minded, but
                shortsighted.</p>

            <p>So as you read the advice that follows, and as you work with
                your own project, remember that there is <span class="emphasis"><em>no one</em></span>
                who is above politics. Appearing to be above politics is merely one
                particular political strategy, and sometimes a very useful one, but it
                is never the reality. Politics is simply what happens when people
                disagree on the use or allocation of a shared asset, and successful
                projects are those that evolve political mechanisms for managing such
                disagreement constructively.</p></div>

            <p>Why do volunteers work on free software
                projects?<sup>[<a name="idp9031680" href="#ftn.idp9031680" class="footnote">58</a>]</sup></p>

            <p>When asked, many claim they do it because they want to produce
                good software, or want to be personally involved in fixing the bugs
                that matter to them. But these reasons are usually not the whole
                story. After all, could you imagine a volunteer staying with a
                project even if no one ever said a word in appreciation of her work,
                or listened to her in discussions? Of course not. Clearly, people
                spend time on free software for reasons beyond just an abstract desire
                to produce good code. Understanding volunteers' true motivations will
                help you arrange things so as to attract and keep them. The desire to
                produce good software may be among those motivations, along with the
                challenge and educational value of working on hard problems. But
                humans also have a built-in desire to work with other humans, and to
                give and earn respect through cooperative activities. Groups engaged
                in cooperative activities must evolve norms of behavior such that
                status is acquired and kept through actions that help the group's
                goals.</p>

            <p>Those norms won't always arise by themselves. For example, on
                some projectsâexperienced open source developers can probably
                name several off the tops of their headsâpeople apparently feel
                that status is acquired by posting frequently and verbosely. They
                don't come to this conclusion accidentally; they come to it because
                they are rewarded with respect for making long, intricate arguments,
                whether or not that actually helps the project. Following are some
                techniques for creating an atmosphere in which status-acquiring
                actions are also <span class="emphasis"><em>constructive</em></span> actions.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Delegation">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="delegation"></a>Delegation</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Delegation is not merely a way to spread the workload around; it
                    is also a political and social tool. Consider all the effects when
                    you ask someone to do something. The most obvious effect is that, if
                    he accepts, he does the task and you don't. But another effect is
                    that he is made aware that you trusted him to handle the task.
                    Furthermore, if you made the request in a public forum, then he knows
                    that others in the group have been made aware of that trust too. He
                    may also feel some pressure to accept, which means you must ask in a
                    way that allows him to decline gracefully if he doesn't really want
                    the job. If the task requires coordination with others in the
                    project, you are effectively proposing that he become more involved,
                    form bonds that might not otherwise have been formed, and perhaps
                    become a source of authority in some subdomain of the project. The
                    added involvement may be daunting, or it may lead him to become
                    engaged in other ways as well, from an increased feeling of overall
                    commitment.</p>

                <p>Because of all these effects, it often makes sense to ask
                    someone else to do something even when you know you could do it faster
                    or better yourself. Of course, there is sometimes a strict economic
                    efficiency argument for this anyway: perhaps the opportunity cost of
                    doing it yourself would be too highâthere might be something
                    even more important you could do with that time. But even when that
                    kind of comparative advantage argument doesn't apply, you may
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> want to ask someone else to take on the
                    task, because in the long run you want to draw that person deeper into
                    the project, even if it means spending extra time watching over them
                    at first. The converse technique also applies: if you occasionally
                    volunteer for work that someone else doesn't want or have time to do,
                    you will gain her good will and respect. Delegation and
                    substitution are not just about getting individual tasks done; they're
                    also about drawing people into a closer committment to the
                    project.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes it is fair to expect that a person will accept a
                        particular task. For example, if someone writes a bug into the code,
                        or commits code that fails to comply with project guidelines in some
                        obvious way, then it is enough to point out the problem and thereafter
                        behave as though you assume the person will take care of it. Also, if
                        they have stated publicly that they will do something, it is
                        reasonable to depend on that. But there are other situations where it
                        is by no means clear that you have a right to expect action. The
                        person may do as you ask, or may not. Since no one likes to be taken
                        for granted, you need to be sensitive to the difference between these
                        two types of situations, and tailor your requests accordingly.</p>

                    <p>One thing that almost always causes people instant annoyance is
                        being asked to do something in a way that implies that you think it is
                        clearly their responsibility to do it, when they feel otherwise. For
                        example, assignment of incoming tickets is particularly fertile ground
                        for this kind of annoyance. The participants in a project usually
                        know who is expert in what areas, so when a bug report comes in, there
                        will often be one or two people whom everyone knows could probably fix
                        it quickly. However, if you assign the ticket over to one of those
                        people without her prior permission, she may feel she has been
                        put into an uncomfortable position. She senses the pressure of
                        expectation, but also may feel that she is, in effect, being
                        punished for her expertise. After all, the way one acquires
                        expertise is by fixing bugs, so perhaps someone else should take this
                        one! (Note that ticket trackers that automatically assign tickets to
                        particular people based on information in the bug report are less
                        likely to offend, because everyone knows that the assignment was made
                        by an automated process, and is not an indication of human
                        expectations.)</p>

                    <p>While it would be nice to spread the load as evenly as possible,
                        there are certain times when you just want to encourage the person who
                        can fix a bug the fastest to do so. Given that you can't afford a
                        communications turnaround for every such assignment ("Would you be
                        willing to look at this bug?" "Yes." "Okay, I'm assigning the ticket
                        over to you then." "Okay."), you should simply make the assignment in
                        the form of an inquiry, conveying no pressure. Virtually all ticket
                        trackers allow a comment to be associated with the assignment of an
                        ticket. In that comment, you can say something like this:</p>

                    <div class="blockquote">
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Assigning this over to you, jrandom, because you're most
                            familiar with this code. Feel free to bounce this back if you
                            don't have time to look at it, though. (And let me know if you'd
                            prefer not to receive such requests in the future.)</p></blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>This distinguishes clearly between the
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>request</em></span> for assignment and the
                        recipient's <span class="emphasis"><em>acceptance</em></span> of that assignment. The
                        audience here isn't only the assignee, it's everyone: the entire group
                        sees a public confirmation of the assignee's expertise, but the
                        message also makes it clear that the assignee is free to accept or
                        decline the responsibility.</p></div>

                    <p>When you ask someone to do something, remember that you have
                        done so, and follow up with him no matter what. Most requests are
                        made in public forums, and are roughly of the form "Can you take care
                        of X? Let us know either way; no problem if you can't, just need to
                        know." You may or may not get a response. If you do, and the
                        response is negative, the loop is closedâyou'll need to try some
                        other strategy for dealing with X. If there is a positive response,
                        then keep an eye out for progress on the issue, and comment on the
                        progress you do or don't see (everyone works better when they know
                        someone else is appreciating their work). If there is no response
                        after a few days, ask again, or post saying that you got no
                        response and are looking for someone else to do it. Or just do it
                        yourself, but still make sure to say that you got no response to the
                        initial inquiry.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of publicly noting the lack of response is
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to humiliate the person, and your remarks
                        should be phrased so as not to have that effect. The purpose is
                        simply to show that you keep track of what you have asked for, and
                        that you notice the reactions you get. This makes people more likely
                        to say yes next time, because they will observe (even if only
                        unconsciously) that you are likely to notice any work they do, given
                        that you noticed the much less visible event of someone failing to
                        respond.</p></div>

                    <p>Another thing that makes people happy is to have their interests
                        noticedâin general, the more aspects of someone's personality
                        you notice and remember, the more comfortable he will be, and the
                        more he will want to work with groups of which you are a
                        part.</p>

                    <p>For example, there was a sharp distinction in the Subversion
                        project between people who wanted to reach a definitive 1.0 release
                        (which we eventually did), and people who mainly wanted to add new
                        features and work on interesting problems but who didn't much care
                        when 1.0 came out. Neither of these positions is better or worse than
                        the other; they're just two different kinds of developers, and both
                        kinds do lots of work on the project. But we swiftly learned that it
                        was important to <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> assume that the excitement
                        of the 1.0 drive was shared by everyone. Electronic media can be very
                        deceptive: you may sense an atmosphere of shared purpose when, in fact,
                        it's shared only by the people you happen to have been talking to,
                        while others have completely different priorities.</p>

                    <p>The more aware you are of what different people want out of the project,
                        the more effectively you can make requests of them. Even just
                        demonstrating an understanding of what they want, without making any
                        associated request, is useful, in that it confirms to each person that
                        she's not just another particle in an undifferentiated mass.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Praise and Criticism">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="praise-and-criticism"></a>Praise and Criticism</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Praise and criticism are not opposites; in many ways, they are
                    very similar. Both are primarily forms of attention, and are most
                    effective when specific rather than generic. Both should be deployed
                    with concrete goals in mind. Both can be diluted by inflation: praise
                    too much or too often and you will devalue your praise; the same is
                    true for criticism, though in practice, criticism is usually reactive
                    and therefore a bit more resistant to devaluation.</p>

                <p>An important feature of technical culture is that detailed,
                    dispassionate criticism is often taken as a kind of praise (as
                    discussed in <a class="xref" href="#rudeness" title="Recognizing Rudeness">the section called
                        âRecognizing Rudenessâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6,
                        <i>Communications</i></a></span>), because of the
                    implication that the recipient's work is worth the time required to
                    analyze it. However, both of those
                    conditionsâ<span class="emphasis"><em>detailed</em></span> and
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>dispassionate</em></span>âmust be met for this to be
                    true. For example, if someone makes a sloppy change to the code, it
                    is useless (and actually harmful) to follow up saying simply "That was
                    sloppy." Sloppiness is ultimately a characteristic of a
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>person</em></span>, not of their work, and it's important to
                    keep your reactions focused on the work. It's much more effective to
                    describe all the things wrong with the change, tactfully and without
                    malice. If this is the third or fourth careless change in a row by
                    the same person, it's appropriate to say thatâagain without
                    angerâat the end of your critique, to make it clear that the
                    pattern has been noticed.</p>

                <p>If someone does not improve in response to criticism, the
                    solution is not more or stronger criticism. The solution is for the
                    group to remove that person from the position of incompetence, in a
                    way that minimizes hurt feelings as much as possible; see
                    <a class="xref" href="#transitions" title="Transitions">the section called âTransitionsâ</a><span> later in
this chapter</span> for examples. That is a rare
                    occurrence, however. Most people respond pretty well to criticism
                    that is specific, detailed, and contains a clear (even if unspoken)
                    expectation of improvement.</p>

                <p>Praise won't hurt anyone's feelings, of course, but that doesn't
                    mean it should be used any less carefully than criticism. Praise is a
                    tool: before you use it, ask yourself <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you
                    want to use it. As a rule, it's not a good idea to regularly praise people for
                    doing what they usually do, or for actions that are a normal and
                    expected part of participating in the group. If you were to do that,
                    it would be hard to know when to stop: should you praise
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> for doing the usual things? After all,
                    if you leave some people out, they'll wonder why. It's much better to
                    express praise and gratitude sparingly, in response to unusual or
                    unexpected efforts, with the intention of encouraging more such
                    efforts. When a participant seems to have moved permanently into a
                    state of higher productivity, adjust your praise threshold for that
                    person accordingly. Repeated praise for normal behavior gradually
                    becomes meaningless anyway. Instead, that person should sense that
                    her high level of productivity is now considered normal and natural,
                    and only work that goes beyond that should be specially noticed.</p>

                <p>This is not to say that the person's contributions shouldn't be
                    acknowledged, of course. But remember that if the project is set up
                    right, everything that person does is already visible anyway, and so
                    the group will know (and the person will know that the rest of the
                    group knows) everything she does. There are also ways to acknowledge
                    someone's work by means other than direct praise. You could mention
                    in passing, while discussing a related topic, that she has done a lot
                    of work in the given area and is the resident expert there; you
                    could publicly consult her on some question about the code; or perhaps
                    most effectively, you could conspicuously make further use of the work
                    she has done, so she sees that others are now comfortable relying on
                    the results of her work. It's probably not necessary to do these
                    things in any calculated way. Someone who regularly makes large
                    contributions in a project will know it, and will occupy a position of
                    influence by default. There's usually no need to take explicit steps
                    to ensure this, unless you sense that, for whatever reason, a
                    contributor is underappreciated.</p></div>

                <p>Watch out for participants who try to stake out exclusive
                    ownership of certain areas of the project, and who seem to want to do
                    all the work in those areas, to the extent of aggressively taking over
                    work that others start. Such behavior may even seem healthy at first.
                    After all, on the surface it looks like the person is taking on more
                    responsibility, and showing increased activity within a given area.
                    But in the long run, it is destructive. When people sense a "no
                    trespassing" sign, they stay away. This results in reduced review in
                    that area, and greater fragility, because the lone developer becomes a
                    single point of failure. Worse, it fractures the cooperative,
                    egalitarian spirit of the project. The theory should always be that
                    any developer is welcome to help out on any task at any time. Of
                    course, in practice things work a bit differently: people do have
                    areas where they are more and less influential, and non-experts
                    frequently defer to experts in certain domains of the project. But
                    the key is that this is all voluntary: informal authority is granted
                    based on competence and proven judgement, but it should never be
                    actively
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>taken</em></span>. Even if the person desiring the authority
                    really is competent, it is still crucial that she hold that authority
                    informally, through the consensus of the group, that the exact
                    boundaries of the authority remain fuzzy and subjective, and that the
                    authority never cause her to exclude others from working in that area.</p>

                <p>Rejecting or editing someone's work for technical reasons is an
                    entirely different matter, of course. There, the decisive factor
                    is the content of the work, not who happened to act as gatekeeper. It
                    may be that the same person happens to do most of the reviewing for a
                    given area, but as long as he never tries to prevent someone else from
                    doing that work too, things are probably okay.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The wonderful term <em class="firstterm">cookie licking</em>,
                        which I first heard from Sumana Harihareswara, can be used for the
                        situation where someone claims, in front of the group, that they're
                        going to take care of a certain task but then does nothing with it.
                        As Sumana says<sup>[<a name="idp9076352" href="#ftn.idp9076352" class="footnote">59</a>]</sup>:
                        "Nobody in their right mind would pick up and eat the licked cookie
                        or finish the [task]." If you think you see an instance of cookie
                        licking happening in your project, simply pointing it out may be
                        enough to de-territorialize the task in question and make others
                        consider picking it up (may be enough to sterilize the cookie,
                        I guess, though at this point staying with the analogy may be more
                        confusing than helpful).</p></div>
                <p>In order to combat incipient territorialism, or even the
                    appearance of it, many projects have taken the step of banning the
                    inclusion of author names or designated maintainer names in source
                    files. I wholeheartedly agree with this practice: we follow it in the
                    Subversion project, and it is more or less official policy at the
                    Apache Software Foundation. ASF member Sander Striker puts it this
                    way:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>At the Apache Software foundation we
                        discourage the
                        use of author tags in source code. There are various reasons for
                        this, apart from the legal ramifications. Collaborative
                        development is about working on projects as a group and caring for
                        the project as a group. Giving credit is good, and should be done,
                        but in a way that does not allow for false attribution, even by
                        implication. There is no clear line for when to add or remove an
                        author tag. Do you add your name when you change a comment? When
                        you put in a one-line fix? Do you remove other author tags when
                        you refactor the code and it looks 95% different? What do you do
                        about people who go about touching every file, changing just enough
                        to make the virtual author tag quota, so that their name will be
                        everywhere?</em></span></p>

                        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>There are better ways to give credit, and our
                            preference is to use those. From a technical standpoint author
                            tags are unnecessary; if you wish to find out who wrote a
                            particular piece of code, the version control system can be
                            consulted to figure that out. Author tags also tend to get out of
                            date. Do you really wish to be contacted in private about a piece
                            of code you wrote five years ago and were glad to have
                            forgotten?</em></span></p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>A software project's source code files are the core of its
                    identity. They should reflect the fact that the developer community
                    as a whole is responsible for them, and not be divided up into
                    little fiefdoms.</p>

                <p>People sometimes argue in favor of author or maintainer tags in
                    source files on the grounds that this gives visible credit to those
                    who have done the most work there. There are two problems with this
                    argument. First, the tags inevitably raise the awkward question of
                    how much work one must do to get one's own name listed there too.
                    Second, they conflate the issue of credit with that of authority:
                    having done work in the past does not imply ownership of the area
                    where the work was done, but it's difficult if not impossible to avoid
                    such an implication when individual names are listed at the tops of
                    source files. In any case, credit information can already be obtained
                    from the version control logs and other out-of-band mechanisms like
                    mailing list archives, so no information is lost by banning it from
                    the source files themselves.<sup>[<a name="idp8986304" href="#ftn.idp8986304"
                                                         class="footnote">60</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>If your project decides to ban individual names from source
                    files, make sure not to go overboard. For instance, many
                    projects have a <code class="filename">contrib/</code> area where small tools and
                    helper scripts are kept, often written by people who are otherwise not
                    associated with the project. It's fine for those files to contain
                    author names, because they are not really maintained by the project as
                    a whole. On the other hand, if a contributed tool starts getting
                    hacked on by other people in the project, eventually you may want to
                    move it to a less isolated location and, assuming the original author
                    approves, remove the author's name, so that the code looks like any
                    other community-maintained resource. If the author is sensitive about
                    this, compromise solutions are acceptable, for example:</p>

                </div>
                <p>But it's better to avoid such compromises, if possible, and most
                    authors are willing to be persuaded, because they're happy that their
                    contribution is being made a more integral part of the project.</p>

                <p>The important thing is to remember that there is a continuum
                    between the core and the periphery of any project. The main source
                    code files for the software are clearly part of the core, and should
                    be considered as maintained by the community. On the other hand,
                    companion tools or pieces of documentation may be the work of single
                    individuals, who maintain them essentially alone, even though the
                    works may be associated with, and even distributed with, the project.
                    There is no need to apply a one-size-fits-all rule to every file, as
                    long as the principle that community-maintained resources are not
                    allowed to become individual territories is upheld.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="The Automation Ratio">

                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="automation"></a>The Automation Ratio</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Try not to let humans do what machines could do instead. As a
                    rule of thumb, automating a common task is worth at least ten times the
                    effort a developer would spend doing that task manually one time. For
                    very frequent or very complex tasks, that ratio could easily go up to
                    twenty or even higher.</p>

                <p>Thinking of yourself as a "project manager", rather than just
                    another developer, may be a useful attitude here. Sometimes
                    individual developers are too wrapped up in low-level work to see the
                    big picture and realize that everyone is wasting a lot of effort
                    performing automatable tasks manually. Even those who do realize it
                    may not take the time to solve the problem: because each individual
                    performance of the task does not feel like a huge burden, no one ever
                    gets annoyed enough to do anything about it. What makes automation
                    compelling is that the small burden is multiplied by the number of
                    times each developer incurs it, and then <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>
                    number is multiplied by the number of developers.</p>

                <p>Here, I am using the term "automation" broadly, to mean not only
                    repeated actions where one or two variables change each time, but any
                    sort of technical infrastructure that assists humans. The minimum
                    standard automation required to run a project these days was described
                    in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                          title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i>Technical
                        Infrastructure</i></a>, but each project
                    may have its own special problems too. For example, a group working
                    on documentation might want to have a web site displaying the most
                    up-to-date versions of the documents at all times. Since
                    documentation is often written in a markup language like XML, there
                    may be a compilation step, often quite intricate, involved in creating
                    displayable or downloadable documents. Arranging a web site where
                    such compilation happens automatically on every commit can be
                    complicated and time-consumingâbut it is worth it, even if it
                    costs you a day or more to set up. The overall benefits of having
                    up-to-date pages available at all times are huge, even though the cost
                    of <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> having them might seem like only a small
                    annoyance at any single moment, to any single developer.</p>

                <p>Taking such steps eliminates not merely wasted time, but the
                    griping and frustration that ensue when humans make missteps (as they
                    inevitably will) in trying to perform complicated procedures manually.
                    Multi-step, deterministic operations are exactly what computers were
                    invented for; save your humans for more interesting things.</p>

                    <p>Automated test runs are helpful for any software project, but
                        especially so for open source projects, because automated testing
                        (especially regression testing) allows developers to feel comfortable
                        changing code in areas they are unfamiliar with, and thus encourages
                        exploratory development. Since detecting breakage is so hard to do by
                        handâone essentially has to guess where one might have broken
                        something, and try various experiments to prove that one
                        didn'tâhaving automated ways to detect such breakage saves the
                        project a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of time. It also makes people much
                        more relaxed about refactoring large swaths of code, and therefore
                        contributes to the software's long-term maintainability.</p>

                        <p><em class="firstterm">Regression testing</em> means testing for
                            the reappearance of already-fixed bugs. The purpose of regression
                            testing is to reduce the chances that code changes will break the
                            software in unexpected ways. As a software project gets bigger and
                            more complicated, the chances of such unexpected side effects
                            increase steadily. Good design can reduce the rate at which the
                            chances increase, but it cannot eliminate the problem
                            entirely.</p>

                        <p>As a result, many projects have a <em class="firstterm">test
                            suite</em>, a separate program that invokes the project's
                            software in ways that have been known in the past to stimulate
                            specific bugs. If the test suite succeeds in making one of these
                            bugs happen, this is known as a <em class="firstterm">regression</em>,
                            meaning that someone's change unexpectedly unfixed a
                            previously-fixed bug.</p>

                        </p></div>
                    <p>Regression testing is not a panacea. For one thing, it works
                        best for programs with batch-style interfaces. Software that is
                        operated primarily through graphical user interfaces is much harder to
                        drive programmatically. Another problem is that the regression test
                        suite framework itself can often be quite complex, with a learning
                        curve and maintenance burden all its own. Reducing this complexity is
                        one of the most useful things you can do, even though it may take a
                        considerable amount of time. The easier it is to add new tests to the
                        suite, the more developers will do so, and the fewer bugs will survive
                        to release. Any effort spent making tests easier to write will be
                        paid back manyfold over the lifetime of the project.</p>

                    <p>Many projects have a <em class="firstterm">"Don't break the
                        build!"</em> rule, meaning: don't commit a change that makes
                        the software unable to compile or run. Being the person who broke the
                        build is usually cause for mild embarrassment and ribbing. Projects
                        with regression test suites often have a corollary rule: don't commit
                        any change that causes tests to fail. Such failures are easiest to
                        spot if there are automatic nightly runs of the entire test suite,
                        with the results mailed out to the development list or to a dedicated
                        test-results mailing list; that's another example of a worthwhile
                        automation.</p>

                    <p>Most volunteer developers are willing to take the extra time to
                        write regression tests, when the test system is comprehensible and
                        easy to work with. Accompanying changes with tests is understood to
                        be the responsible thing to do, and it's also an easy opportunity for
                        collaboration: often two developers will divide up the work for a
                        bugfix, with one writing the fix itself, and the other writing the
                        test. The latter developer may often end up with more work, and since
                        writing a test is already less satisfying than actually fixing the
                        bug, it is imperative that the test suite not make the experience more
                        painful than it has to be.</p>

                    <p>Some projects go even further, requiring that a new test
                        accompany <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> bugfix or new feature. Whether
                        this is a good idea or not depends on many factors: the nature of the
                        software, the makeup of the development team, and the difficulty of
                        writing new tests. The CVS (<a class="ulink" href="http://cvs.nongnu.org/" target="_top">cvs.nongnu.org/</a>)
                        project has long had such a rule. It is a good policy in theory,
                        since CVS is version control software and therefore very risk-averse
                        about the possibility of munging or mishandling the user's data. The
                        problem in practice is that CVS's regression test suite is a single
                        huge shell script (amusingly named <code class="filename">sanity.sh</code>),
                        hard to read and hard to modify or extend. The difficulty of adding
                        new tests, combined with the requirement that patches be accompanied
                        by new tests, means that CVS effectively discourages patches. When I
                        used to work on CVS, I sometimes saw people start on and even complete
                        a patch to CVS's own code, but give up when told of the requirement to
                        add a new test to <code class="filename">sanity.sh</code>.</p>

                    <p>It is normal to spend more time writing a new regression test
                        than on fixing the original bug. But CVS carried this phenomenon to
                        an extreme: one might spend hours trying to design one's test
                        properly, and still get it wrong, because there are just too many
                        unpredictable complexities involved in changing a 35,000-line Bourne
                        shell script. Even longtime CVS developers often grumbled when they
                        had to add a new test.</p>

                    <p>This situation was due to a failure on all our parts to consider
                        the automation ratio. It is true that switching to a real test
                        frameworkâwhether custom-built or off-the-shelfâwould have
                        been a major effort.<sup>[<a name="idp9123472" href="#ftn.idp9123472"
                                                     class="footnote">61</a>]</sup> But neglecting to do so has
                        cost the project much more, over the years. How many bugfixes and new
                        features are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> in CVS today, because of the
                        impediment of an awkward test suite? We cannot know the exact number,
                        but it is surely many times greater than the number of bugfixes or new
                        features the developers might forgo in order to develop a new test
                        system (or integrate an off-the-shelf system). That task would only
                        take a finite amount of time, while the penalty of using the current
                        test suite will continue forever if nothing is done.</p>

                    <p>The point is not that having strict requirements to write tests
                        is bad, nor that writing your test system as a Bourne shell script is
                        necessarily bad. It might work fine, depending on how you design it
                        and what it needs to test. The point is simply that when the test
                        system becomes a significant impediment to development, something must
                        be done. The same is true for any routine process that turns into a
                        barrier or a bottleneck.</p></div>

                </div>
                <p>Each interaction with a user is an opportunity to get a new
                    volunteer. When a user takes the time to post to one of the project's
                    mailing lists, or to file a bug report, she has already tagged herself
                    as having more potential for involvement than most users (from whom
                    the project will never hear at all). Follow up on that potential: if
                    she described a bug, thank her for the report and ask her if he wants
                    to try fixing it. If she wrote to say that an important question was
                    missing from the FAQ, or that the program's documentation was
                    deficient in some way, then freely acknowledge the problem (assuming
                    it really exists) and ask if she's interested in writing the missing
                    material herself. Naturally, much of the time the user will demur.
                    But it doesn't cost much to ask, and every time you do, it reminds the
                    other listeners in that forum that getting involved in the project is
                    something anyone can do.</p>

                <p>Don't limit your goals to acquiring new developers and
                    documentation writers. For example, even training people to write
                    good bug reports pays off in the long run, if you don't spend
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> much time per person, and if they go on
                    to submit more bug reports in the futureâwhich they are more
                    likely to do if they got a constructive reaction to their first
                    report. A constructive reaction need not be a fix for the bug,
                    although that's always the ideal; it can also be a solicitation for
                    more information, or even just a confirmation that the behavior
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a bug. People want to be listened to.
                    Secondarily, they want their bugs fixed. You may not always be able
                    to give them the latter in a timely fashion, but you (or rather, the
                    project as a whole) can give them the former.</p>

                <p>A corollary of this is that developers should not express anger
                    at people who file well-intended but vague bug reports. This is one
                    of my personal pet peeves; I see developers do it all the time on
                    various open source mailing lists, and the harm it does is palpable.
                    Some hapless newbie will post a useless report:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Hi, I can't get Scanley to run. Every time I start it up, it
                        just errors. Is anyone else seeing this problem?</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>Some developerâwho has seen this kind of report a
                    thousand times, and hasn't stopped to think that the newbie has
                    notâwill respond like this:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What are we supposed to do with so little information?
                        Sheesh. Give us at least some details, like the version of
                        Scanley, your operating system, and the error.</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>This developer has failed to see things from the user's point of
                    view, and also failed to consider the effect such a reaction might
                    have on all the <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> people watching the
                    exchange. Naturally a user who may have no programming experience, and no
                    prior experience reporting bugs, will not know how to write a bug
                    report. What is the right way to handle such a person? Educate them!
                    And do it in such a way that they come back for more:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Sorry you're having trouble. We'll need more information in
                        order to figure out what's happening here. Please tell us the
                        version of Scanley, your operating system, and the exact text of
                        the error. The very best thing you can do is send a transcript
                        showing the exact commands you ran, and the output they produced.

                </div>
                <p>This way of responding is far more effective at
                    extracting the needed information from the user, because it is written
                    to the user's point of view. First, it expresses sympathy:
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>You had a problem; we feel your pain</em></span>. (This is
                    not necessary in every bug report response; it depends on the severity
                    of the problem and how upset the user seemed.) Second, instead of
                    belittling him for not knowing how to report a bug, it tells him how,
                    and in enough detail to be actually usefulâfor example, many
                    users don't realize that "show us the error" means "show us the exact
                    text of the error, with no omissions or abridgements." The first time
                    you work with such a user, you need to be specific about that.
                    Finally, it offers a pointer to much more detailed and complete
                    instructions for reporting bugs. If you have successfully engaged
                    with the user, he will often take the time to read that document and
                    do what it says. This means, of course, that you have to have the
                    document prepared in advance. It should give clear instructions about
                    what kind of information your development team wants to see in every
                    bug report. Ideally, it should also evolve over time in response to
                    the particular sorts of omissions and misreports users tend to make
                    for your project.</p>

                                                                              href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html"
                                                                              target="_top">subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html</a>,
                    are a fairly
                    standard example of the form. Notice how they include an
                    invitation to provide a patch to fix the bug. This is not because
                    such an invitation will lead to a greater patch/report
                    ratioâmost users who are capable of fixing bugs already know
                    that a patch would be welcome, and don't need to be told. The
                    invitation's real purpose is to emphasize to all readers, especially
                    those new to the project or new to free software in general, that the
                    project runs on participation. In a sense, the project's
                    current developers are no more responsible for fixing the bug than is
                    the person who reported it. This is an important point that many new
                    users will not be familiar with. Once they realize it, they're more
                    likely to help make the fix happen, if not by contributing code then
                    by providing a more thorough reproduction recipe, or by offering to
                    test fixes that other people post. The goal is to make every user
                    realize that there is no <span class="emphasis"><em>innate</em></span> difference
                    between himself and the people who work on the projectâthat
                    it's a question of how much time and effort one puts in, not a
                    question of who one is.</p>

                <p>The admonition against responding angrily does not apply to rude
                    users. Occasionally people post bug reports or complaints that,
                    regardless of their informational content, show a sneering contempt at
                    the project for some failing. Often such people are alternately
                    insulting and flattering, such as the person who posted this to a
                    Subversion mailing list:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Why is it that after almost 6 days there still aren't any
                        binaries posted for the windows platform?!? It's the same story every
                        time and it's pretty frustrating. Why aren't these things automated
                        so that they could be available immediately?? When you post an "RC"
                        build, I think the idea is that you want users to test the build, but
                        yet you don't provide any way of doing so. Why even have a soak
                        period if you provide no means of testing??</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>Initial response to this rather inflammatory post was
                    surprisingly restrained: people pointed out that the project had a
                    published policy of not providing official binaries, and said, with
                    varying degrees of annoyance, that he ought to volunteer to produce
                    them himself if they were so important to him. Believe it or not, his
                    next post started with these lines:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>First of all, let me say that I think Subversion is awesome and
                        I really appreciate the efforts of everyone involved. [...]</p></blockquote>
                </div>
                <p>...and then he went on to berate the project
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>again</em></span> for not providing binaries, while
                    still not volunteering to do anything about it. After that, about
                    50 people just jumped all over him, and I can't say I really
                    minded. Retaliatory rudeness should be avoided toward people with
                    whom the project has (or would like to have) a sustained interaction.
                    But when someone makes it clear from the start that he is going to
                    be a fountain of bile, there is no point making him feel welcome.</p>

                <p>Such situations are fortunately quite rare, and they are
                    noticeably rarer in projects that make an effort to engage users
                    constructively and courteously from their very first
                    interaction.</p></div>

            <p>Share the management burden as well as the technical burden of
                running the project. As a project becomes more complex, an increasing
                proportion of the work becomes about managing people and information flow.
                There is no reason not to share that burden, and sharing it does not
                necessarily require a top-down hierarchy either. In fact, what happens in
                practice tends to be more of a peer-to-peer network topology than a
                military-style command structure.</p>

            <p>Sometimes management roles are formalized and sometimes they
                happen spontaneously. In the Subversion project, we have a patch
                manager, a translation manager, documentation managers, issue managers
                (albeit unofficial), and a release manager. Some of these roles we
                made a conscious decision to initiate, others just happened by
                themselves. Here we'll examine these roles, and a couple of others,

                <p>As you read the role descriptions below, notice that none of them
                    requires exclusive control over the domain in question. The issue
                    manager does not prevent other people from making changes in the
                    tickets database, the FAQ manager does not insist on being the only
                    person to edit the FAQ, and so on. These roles are all about
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>responsibility without monopoly</em></span>. An important
                    part of each domain
                    manager's job is to notice when other people are working in that domain,
                    and train them to do the things the way the manager does, so that the
                    multiple efforts reinforce rather than conflict. Domain managers
                    should also document the processes by which they do their work, so
                    that when one leaves, someone else can pick up the slack right
                    away.</p>

                <p>Sometimes there is a conflict: two or more people want the same
                    role. There is no one right way to handle this. You just have to
                    draw on your knowledge of the project and of the people involved and
                    suggest a resolution. In some cases it will work to just put on your
                    "benevolent dictator" hat and choose one of the people. But I find
                    that a better technique is just to ask the multiple candidates to
                    settle it among themselves. They usually will, and will be more
                    satisfied with the result than if a decision had been imposed on them
                    from the outside. They may even decide on a co-management
                    arrangement, which is fine if it works, and if it doesn't then you're
                    right back where you started and can try a different resolution.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In a free software project that receives a lot of patches,
                        keeping track of which patches have arrived and what has been decided
                        about them can be a nightmare, especially if done in a decentralized
                        way. Most patches arrive either as posts to the project's development
                        mailing list or as a pull request submitted through the version
                        control system, but there are a number of different routes a patch can
                        take after arrival.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes someone reviews the patch, finds problems, and bounces
                        it back to the original author for cleanup. This usually leads to an
                        iterative processâall visible in a public forumâin which
                        the original author posts revised versions of the patch until the
                        reviewer has nothing more to criticize. It is not always easy to tell
                        when this process is done: if the reviewer commits the patch, then
                        clearly the cycle is complete. But if she does not, it might be
                        because she simply didn't have time, or doesn't have commit access
                        herself and couldn't rope any of the other developers into doing
                        it.</p>

                    <p>Another frequent response to a patch is a freewheeling
                        discussion, not necessarily about the patch itself, but about whether
                        the concept behind the patch is good. For example, the patch may fix
                        a bug, but the project prefers to fix that bug in another way, as part
                        of solving a more general class of problems. Often this is not known
                        in advance, and it is the patch that stimulates the discovery.</p>

                    <p>Occasionally, a posted patch is met with utter silence. Usually
                        this is due to no developer having time <span class="emphasis"><em>at that
                            moment</em></span> to review the patch, so each hopes that someone else
                        will do it. Since there's no particular limit to how long each person
                        waits for someone else to pick up the ball, and meanwhile other
                        priorities are always coming up, it's very easy for a patch to be
                        ignored permanently without any single person intending for that to
                        happen. The project might miss out on a useful patch this way, and
                        there are other harmful side effects as well: it is discouraging to
                        the author, who invested work in the patch, and it is discouraging
                        to others considering writing patches.</p>

                    <p>The patch manager's job is to make sure that patches don't "slip
                        through the cracks." This is done by following every patch through to
                        some sort of stable state. The patch manager watches every issue
                        tracker discussion, pull request, or mailing list thread that results
                        from a patch
                        posting. If it ends with a commit of the patch, he does nothing. If it
                        goes into a review/revise iteration, ending with a final version of
                        the patch but no commit, he creates or updates a ticket to point to
                        the final version, and to any discussion around it, so that there is a
                        permanent record for developers to follow up on later. In projects
                        that use a patch queue manager or review tool (e.g., <a class="ulink"
                                                                                href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/"
                                                                                target="_top">Gerrit</a>, <a
                                class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_Board" target="_top">Review_Board</a>,
                        etc), the patch manager can help encourage
                        consistent usage of that tool, by putting patches there and watching
                        to make sure developers handle them there.</p>

                    <p>When a patch gets no reaction at all, the patch manager waits a
                        few days, then follows up asking if anyone is going to review it.
                        This usually gets a reaction: a developer may explain that she doesn't
                        think the patch should be applied, and give the reasons why, or she
                        may review it, in which case one of the previously described paths is
                        taken. If there is still no response, the patch manager may or may
                        not file a ticket for the patch, at his discretion, but at least the
                        original submitter got <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> reaction. The true
                        currency of open source projects is attention: people who can see that
                        they are getting attention will keep participating, even if not every
                        patch they submit lands.</p>

                    <p>Having a patch manager has saved the Subversion development team
                        a lot of time and mental energy. Without a designated person to take
                        responsibility, every developer would constantly have to worry "If I
                        don't have time to respond to this patch right now, can I count on
                        someone else doing it? Should I try to keep an eye on it? But if
                        other people are also keeping an eye on it, for the same reasons, then
                        we'd have needlessly duplicated effort." The patch manager removes
                        the second-guessing from the situation. Each developer can make the
                        decision that is right for her at the moment she first sees the patch.
                        If she wants to follow up with a review, she can do thatâthe
                        patch manager will adjust his behavior accordingly. If she wants to
                        ignore the patch completely, that's fine too; the patch manager will
                        make sure it isn't forgotten.</p>

                    <p>Because this system works only if people can depend on the patch
                        manager being there without fail, the role should be held formally.
                        In Subversion, we advertised for it on the development and users
                        mailing lists, got several volunteers, and took the first one who
                        replied. When that person had to step down (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#transitions" title="Transitions">the section called
                            âTransitionsâ</a><span> later in
this chapter</span>), we did the same thing again.
                        We've never tried having multiple people share the role, because of
                        the communications overhead that would be required between them; but
                        perhaps at very high volumes of patch submission, a multiheaded patch
                        manager might make sense.</p></div>
                <div class="sect3" title="Translation Manager">
                    <div class="titlepage">

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>In software projects, "translation" can refer to two somewhat
                        different things. It can mean translating the software's
                        documentation into other languages, or it can mean translating the
                        software itselfâthat is, having the program display errors and
                        help messages in the user's preferred language. Both are complex
                        tasks, but once the right infrastructure is in place, they are largely
                        separable from other development. Because the tasks are similar in
                        some ways, it may make sense (depending on your project) to have a
                        single translation manager handle both, or it may be better to have
                        two different managers.</p>

                    <p>In the Subversion project, we had one translation manager handle
                        both. He did not actually write the translations himself, of
                        courseâhe might help out on one or two, but would need to speak
                        more than ten languages fluently in order to work on all of them!
                        Instead, he managed teams of volunteer translators: he helped them
                        coordinate among each other, and he coordinated between the
                        translation teams and the rest of the project.</p>

                    <p>Part of the reason the translation manager is necessary is that
                        translators are a different demographic from developers. They
                        sometimes have little or no experience working in a version control
                        repository, or indeed with working as part of a distributed volunteer
                        team at all. But in other respects they are often the best kind of
                        volunteer: people with specific domain knowledge who saw a need and
                        chose to get involved. They are usually willing to learn, and
                        enthusiastic to get to work. All they need is someone to tell them
                        how. The translation manager makes sure that the translations happen
                        in a way that does not interfere unnecessarily with regular
                        development. He also serves as a sort of representative of the
                        translators as a unified body, whenever the developers must be
                        informed of technical changes required to support the translation
                        effort.</p>

                    <p>Thus, the position's most important skills are diplomatic, not
                        technical. For example, in Subversion we had a policy that all
                        translations should have at least two people working on them, because
                        otherwise there is no way for the text to be reviewed. When a new
                        volunteer shows up offering to translate Subversion to, say, Malagasy,
                        the translation manager has to either hook him up with someone who
                        posted six months ago expressing interest in doing a Malagasy
                        translation, or else politely ask the volunteer to go
                        find <span class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> Malagasy translator to work with as
                        a partner. Once enough people are available, the manager sets them up
                        with the proper kind of commit access, informs them of the project's
                        conventions (such as how to write log messages), and then keeps an eye
                        out to make sure they adhere to those conventions.</p>

                    <p>Conversations between the translation manager and the
                        developers, or between the translation manager and translation teams,
                        are usually held in the project's original languageâthat is, the
                        language from which all the translations are being made. For most
                        free software projects, this is English, but it doesn't matter what it
                        is as long as the project agrees on it. (English is probably best for
                        projects that want to attract a broad international development
                        community, though.)</p>

                    <p>Conversations <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> a particular
                        translation team usually happen in their shared language, however, and
                        one of the other tasks of the translation manager is to set up a
                        dedicated mailing list for each team. That way the translators can
                        discuss their work freely, without distracting people on the project's
                        main lists, most of whom would not be able to understand the
                        translation language anyway.</p>

                            in a Slovenian environment, is a localization move.</p>

                        <p>Thus, the translation manager's task is principally about
                            localization, not internationalization.</p></div>

                    <p>Keeping software documentation up-to-date is a never-ending
                        task. Every new feature or enhancement that goes into the code has
                        the potential to cause a change in the documentation. Also, once the
                        project's documentation reaches a certain level of completeness, you
                        will find that a lot of the patches people send in are for the
                        documentation, not for the code. This is because there are many more
                        people competent to fix bugs in prose than in code: all users are
                        readers, but only a few are programmers.</p>

                    <p>Documentation patches are usually easier to review and
                        apply than code patches. There is little or no testing to be done,
                        and the quality of the change can be evaluated quickly just by examination.
                        Since the quantity is high, but the review burden fairly low, the
                        ratio of administrative overhead to productive work is greater for
                        documentation patches than for code patches. Furthermore, most of the
                        patches will probably need some sort of adjustment, in order to
                        maintain a consistent authorial voice in the documentation. In many
                        cases, patches will overlap with or affect other patches, and need to
                        be adjusted with respect to each other before being committed.</p>

                    <p>Given the exigencies of handling documentation patches, and the
                        fact that the code base needs to be constantly monitored so the
                        documentation can be kept up-to-date, it makes sense to have one
                        person, or a small team, dedicated to the task. They can keep a
                        record of exactly where and how the documentation lags behind the
                        software, and they can have practiced procedures for handling large
                        quantities of patches in an integrated way.</p>

                    <p>Of course, this does not preclude other people in the project
                        from applying documentation patches on the fly, especially small ones,
                        as time permits. And the same patch manager (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#patch-manager" title="Patch Manager">the section called âPatch
                            Managerâ</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>) can track both code and
                        documentation patches, filing them wherever the development and
                        documentation teams want them, respectively. (If the total quantity of
                        patches ever exceeds one human's capacity to track, though, switching
                        to separate patch managers for code and documentation is probably a
                        good first step.) The point of a documentation team is to ensure that
                        there are people
                        who think of themselves as responsible for keeping the documentation
                        organized, up-to-date, and consistent with itself. In practice, this
                        means knowing the documentation intimately, watching the code base,
                        watching the changes
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>others</em></span> commit to the documentation, watching for
                        incoming documentation patches, and using all these information
                        sources to do whatever is necessary to keep the documentation
                        healthy. If the documentation is kept in a wiki, then of course the
                        wiki's "watch changes" feature can be very important to the
                        documentation managers, since (depending on the wiki's edit policy)
                        changes may land without going through a pre-change review process.</p></div>

                    <p>Bug report growth is proportional to user base growth, rather
                        than to the number of actual bugs in the software. That is, the
                        number of tickets in a project's bug tracker grows in proportion to
                        the number of people <span class="emphasis"><em>using</em></span> the
                        software.<sup>[<a name="idp9203264" href="#ftn.idp9203264" class="footnote">62</a>]</sup>
                        Therefore, even as you
                        fix bugs and ship an increasingly robust, mature program, you should
                        still expect the number of open tickets to grow essentially without
                        bound. The frequency of duplicate tickets will thus also increase, as
                        will the frequency of incomplete or poorly described tickets.</p>

                    <p>An <em class="firstterm">issue manager</em><sup>[<a name="idp9205616" href="#ftn.idp9205616"
                                                                           class="footnote">63</a>]</sup> helps cope
                        with this situation by watching what
                        goes into the database, and periodically sweeping through it looking
                        for specific problems. Their most common action is probably to fix up
                        incoming tickets, either because the reporter didn't set some of the
                        form fields correctly, or because the ticket is a duplicate of one
                        already in the database. Obviously, the more familiar an issue
                        manager is with the project's bug database, and with the
                        issue-tracking software's user interface and APIs, the more
                        efficiently she will be able to detect and handle duplicate tickets.
                        This is why it is often good to have a few people specialize in the
                        bug database, instead of everyone trying to do it <span class="foreignphrase"><em
                                class="foreignphrase">ad
                            hoc</em></span>. Although every developer in the project needs a
                        certain basic level of competence in manipulating the issue tracker,
                        having a few specialists becomes increasingly important as the project
                        matures. When a project tries to spread collective responsibility for
                        the bug database across everyone, no single individual acquires a deep
                        enough expertise in the content of the database or the tracker's
                        features.</p>

                    <p>Issue managers can help map between tickets and individual
                        developers. When there are a lot of bug reports coming in, not every
                        developer may read the ticket notification mailing list with equal
                        attention. However, if someone who knows the development team is
                        keeping an eye on all incoming tickets, then she can discreetly direct
                        certain developers' attention to specific bugs when appropriate. Of
                        course, this has to be done with a sensitivity to everything else
                        going on in development, and to the recipient's desires and
                        temperament. Therefore, it is often best for issue managers to be
                        developers themselves.</p>

                    <p>Depending on how your project uses the ticket tracker, issue
                        managers can also shape the database to reflect the project's
                        priorities. For example, in Subversion we scheduled tickets into
                        specific future releases, so that when someone asks "When will bug X
                        be fixed?" we could say "Two releases from now," even if we can't give
                        an exact date. The releases are represented in the ticket tracker as
                        target milestones (something most ticket trackers support). As a
                        rule, every Subversion release has one major new feature and a list of
                        specific bug fixes. We assigned the appropriate target milestone to
                        all the tickets planned for that release (including the new
                        featureâit got a ticket too), so that people could view the bug
                        database through the lens of release scheduling. These targets rarely
                        remain static, however. As new bugs come in, priorities sometimes get
                        shifted around, and tickets must be moved from one milestone to
                        another so that each release remains manageable. This, again, is best
                        done by people who have an overall sense of what's in the database,
                        and how various tickets relate to each other.</p>

                    <p>Another thing issue managers do is notice when tickets become
                        obsolete. Sometimes a bug is fixed accidentally as part of an
                        unrelated change to the software, or sometimes the project changes its
                        mind about whether a certain behavior is buggy. Finding obsoleted
                        tickets is not easy: the only way to do it systematically is by making
                        a sweep over all the tickets in the database. But full sweeps become less
                        and less feasible over time, as the number of tickets grows.
                        After a certain point, the only way to keep the database sane is to use a
                        divide-and-conquer approach: categorize tickets immediately on arrival
                        and direct them to the appropriate developer's or team's attention.
                        The recipient then takes charge of the ticket for the rest of its
                        lifetime, shepherding it to resolution or oblivion as necessary. When
                        the database is that large, the issue manager becomes more of an
                        overall coordinator, spending less time looking at each ticket herself
                        and more time getting it into the right person's hands.</p></div>

            <p>From time to time, a person in a position of ongoing
                responsibility (e.g., patch manager, translation manager, etc.) will
                become unable to perform the duties of the position. It may be
                because the job turned out to be more work than he anticipated, or it
                may be due to other factors: a change in responsibilities at his job,
                a new baby, or whatever.</p>

            <p>When a person gets swamped like this, he usually doesn't
                notice it right away. It happens by slow degrees, and there's no
                point at which he consciously realizes that he can no longer fulfill
                the duties of the role. Instead, the rest of the project just doesn't
                hear much from him for a while. Then there will suddenly be a flurry
                of activity, as he feels guilty for neglecting the project for so long
                and sets aside a night to catch up. Then you won't hear from him for
                a while longer, and then there might or might not be another flurry.
                But there's rarely an unsolicited formal resignation. To resign
                would mean openly acknowledging to himself that his circumstances have
                changed and that his ability to fulfill a committment has been
                permanently reduced. People are often reluctant to admit that.</p>

            <p>Therefore, it's up to you and the others in the project to
                notice what's happeningâor rather, not happeningâand to
                ask the person what's going on. The inquiry should be friendly and
                100% guilt-free. Your purpose is to find out a piece
                of information, not to make the person feel bad. Generally, the
                inquiry should be visible to the rest of the project, but if you know
                of some special reason why a private inquiry would be better, that's
                fine too. The main reason to do it publicly is so that if the
                person responds by saying that he won't be able to do the job
                anymore, there's a context established for your
                <span class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> public post: a request for a new person
                to fill that role.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, a person is unable to do the job he's taken on,
                but is either unaware or unwilling to admit that fact. Of course,
                anyone may have trouble at first, especially if the responsibility is
                complex. However, if someone just isn't working out in the role he's
                taken on, even after everyone else has given all the help and
                suggestions they can, then the only solution is for him to step aside
                and let someone new have a try. And if the person doesn't see this
                himself, he'll need to be told. There's basically only one way to
                handle this, I think, but it's a multistep process and each step is
                important.</p>

            <p>First, make sure you're not crazy. Privately talk to others in
                the project to see if they agree that the problem is as serious as you
                think it is. Even if you're already positive, this serves the purpose
                of letting others know that you're considering asking the person to
                step aside. Usually no one will object to thatâthey'll just be
                happy you're taking on the awkward task, so they don't have to!</p>

            <p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>privately</em></span> contact the person in
                question and tell him, kindly but directly, about the problems you
                see. Be specific, giving as many examples as possible. Make sure to
                point out how people had tried to help, but that the problems
                persisted without improving. You should expect this email to take a
                long time to write, but with this sort of message, if you don't back
                up what you're saying, you shouldn't say it at all. Say that you
                would like to find a someone new to fill the role, but also point
                out that there are many other ways to contribute to the project. At
                this stage, don't say that you've talked to others about it; nobody
                likes to be told that people were conspiring behind his back.</p>

            <p>There are a few different ways things can go after that. The
                most likely reaction is that he'll agree with you, or at any rate not
                want to argue, and be willing to step down. In that case, suggest
                that he make the announcement himself, and then you can follow up with
                a post seeking a replacement.</p>

            <p>Or, he may agree that there have been problems, but ask for a
                little more time (or for one more chance, in the case of discrete-task
                roles like release manager). How you react to that is a judgement
                call, but whatever you do, don't agree to it just because you feel
                like you can't refuse such a reasonable request. That would prolong
                the agony, not lessen it. There is often a very good reason to refuse
                the request, namely, that there have already been plenty of chances,
                and that's how things got to where they are now. Here's how I put it
                in a mail to someone who was filling the release manager role but was
                not really suited for it:</p>

            <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="screen">&gt; If you wish to replace me with some one else, I will gracefully
&gt; pass on the role to who comes next.  I have one request, which
&gt; I hope is not unreasonable.  I would like to attempt one more
&gt; release in an effort to prove myself.

I totally understand the desire (been there myself!), but in
this case, we shouldn't do the "one more try" thing.

This isn't the first or second release, it's the sixth or
seventh... And for all of those, I know you've been dissatisfied
with the results too (because we've talked about it before).  So
we've effectively already been down the one-more-try route.
Eventually, one of the tries has to be the last one... I think
[this past release] should be it.
</pre>
                </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>In the worst case, the person may disagree outright. Then
                you have to accept that things are going to be awkward and plow ahead
                anyway. Now is the time to say that you talked to other people about
                it (but still don't say who until you have their permission, since
                those conversations were confidential), and that you don't think it's
                good for the project to continue as things are. Be insistent, but
                never threatening. Keep in mind that with most roles, the transition
                really happens the moment someone new starts doing the job,
                <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the moment the old person stops doing it.
                For example, if the contention is over the role of, say, issue
                manager, at any point you and other influential people in the project
                can solicit for a new issue manager. It's not actually necessary that
                the person who was previously doing it stop doing it, as long as he
                does not sabotage (deliberately or otherwise) the efforts of the new
                person.</p>

            <p>Which leads to a tempting thought: instead of asking the person
                to resign, why not just frame it as a matter of getting him some help?
                Why not just have two issue managers, or patch managers, or whatever
                the role is?</p>

            <p>Although that may sound nice in theory, it is generally not a
                good idea. What makes the manager roles workâwhat makes them
                useful, in factâis their centralization. Those things that can
                be done in a decentralized fashion are usually already being done that
                way. Having two people fill one managerial role introduces
                communications overhead between those two people, as well as the
                potential for slippery displacement of responsibility ("I thought you
                brought the first aid kit!" "Me? No, I thought
                <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> brought the first aid kit!"). Of course,
                there are exceptions. Sometimes two people work extremely well
                together, or the nature of the role is such that it can easily be
                spread across multiple people. But these are not likely to be applicable
                when you see someone flailing in a role he is not suited for. If
                he'd appreciated the problem in the first place, he would have sought
                such help before now. In any case, it would be disrespectful to let
                someone waste time continuing to do a job no one will pay attention
                to.</p>

            <p>The most important factor in asking someone to step down is
                privacy: giving him the space to make a decision without feeling like
                others are watching and waiting. I once made the mistakeâan
                obvious mistake, in retrospectâof mailing all three parties at
                once in order to ask Subversion's release manager to step aside in
                favor of two others who were ready to step up. I'd already talked to
                the two new
                people privately, and knew that they were willing to take on the
                responsibility. So I thought, naÃ¯vely and somewhat
                insensitively, that I'd save some time and hassle by sending one mail
                to all of them to initiate the transition. I assumed that the current
                release manager was already fully aware of the problems and would see
                the reasonableness of my point immediately.</p>

            <p>I was wrong. The current release manager was very offended, and
                rightly so. It's one thing to be asked to hand off the job; it's
                another thing to be asked that <span class="emphasis"><em>in front of</em></span> the
                people you'll hand it off to. Once I got it through my head why he
                was offended, I apologized. He eventually did step aside gracefully,
                and continues to be involved with the project today. But his
                feelings were hurt, and needless to say, this was not the most
                auspicious of beginnings for the new release managers either.</p></div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>For the purposes of this section, the word
                    <em class="firstterm">committer</em> means one of the official
                    maintainers of the software&nbsp;â&nbsp;a committer is someone
                    who has <em class="firstterm">commit access</em>: the right to make
                    changes to the copy of the code that will be used for the project's
                    next official release.</p>

                <p>This precise definition is important because, after all,
                    anyone can set up a repository containing a copy of the project's
                    code and allow themselves to commit to that repository; indeed,
                    doing so is a standard development procedure with decentralized
                    version control systems such as Git. But what really matters for
                    the project's purposes is who has the ability to put changes into
                    the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> copy&nbsp;â&nbsp;that is, the
                    central shared copy into which contributors' changes are merged and
                    from which releases are made.</p>

                <p>Because in older, centralized version control systems, there
                    was normally only one repository anyway, the term "commit access"
                    corresponded closely to who was actually using the "commit" command
                    (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-commit"><em class="firstterm">commit</em></a><span>
  in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                        <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) to put
                    changes into the group's shared repository. These days it
                    corresponds to those who run the "push" or "pull" commands (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-push"><em class="firstterm">push</em></a> and <a class="xref"
                                                                                                          href="#vc-vocabulary-pull"><em
                            class="firstterm">pull</em></a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                                                        title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3,
                        <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) to put changes into
                    that repository. It is the same idea either way: the master
                    repository is a social concept, not a technical concept, and the
                    mechanics of how changes get into it are not important here. Open
                    source projects continue to use the term "committer" as a synonym
                    for "official maintainer", even though formally speaking the
                    "commit" command is no longer where the gating happens.</p></div>
            <p>As the only formally distinct class of people found in all open
                source projects, committers deserve special attention in this book.
                Committers are an unavoidable concession to discrimination in a system
                which is otherwise as non-discriminatory as possible. But
                "discrimination" is not meant as a pejorative here. The function
                committers perform is utterly necessary, and I do not think a project
                could succeed without it. Quality control requires, well, control.
                There are always many people who feel competent to make changes to a
                program, and some smaller number who actually are. The project cannot
                rely on people's own judgement; it must impose standards and grant
                commit access only to those who meet them. On the other
                hand, having people who can commit changes directly working
                side-by-side with people who cannot sets up an obvious power dynamic.
                That dynamic must be managed so that it does not harm the
                project.</p>

            <p>In <a class="xref" href="#electorate" title="Who Votes?">the section called âWho Votes?â</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>, we already
                discussed the mechanics of considering new committers. Here we will
                look at the standards by which potential new committers should be
                judged, and how this process should be presented to the larger
                community.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Choosing Committers">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="choosing-committers"></a>Choosing Committers</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In the Subversion project, we choose committers primarily on the
                    Hippocratic Principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>first, do no harm</em></span>. Our
                    main criterion is not technical skill or even knowledge of the code,
                    but merely that the person show good judgement. Judgement includes
                    knowing what not to take on. Someone might post only small patches,
                    fixing fairly simple problems in the code, but if her patches apply
                    cleanly, do not contain bugs, and are mostly in accord with the
                    project's log message and coding conventions, and there are enough
                    patches to show a clear pattern, then an existing committer will
                    usually propose her for commit access. If at least three people say
                    yes, and no one objects, then the offer is made. True, we might have
                    no evidence that the person is able to solve complex problems in all
                    areas of the code base, but that is irrelevant: the person has made it
                    clear that she is capable of judging her own abilities, and that is
                    the important thing. Technical skills can be learned (and taught),
                    but judgement, for the most part, cannot. Therefore, it is the one
                    thing you want to make sure a person has before you give her commit
                    access.</p>

                <p>When a new committer proposal does provoke a discussion, it is
                    usually not about technical ability, but rather about the person's
                    behavior in the project's discussion forums. Sometimes someone shows
                    technical skill and an ability to work within the project's formal
                    guidelines, yet is also consistently belligerent or uncooperative in
                    public forums. That's a serious concern; if the person doesn't seem
                    to shape up over time, even in response to hints, then we won't add
                    her as a committer no matter how skilled she is. In a volunteer
                    group, social skills, or the ability to "play well in the sandbox",
                    are as important as raw technical ability. Because everything is
                    under version control, the penalty for adding a committer you
                    shouldn't have added is not so much the problems it could cause in the
                    code (review would spot those quickly anyway), but that it might
                    eventually force the project to revoke the person's commit
                    accessâan action that is never pleasant and can sometimes be
                    confrontational.</p>

                <p>Some projects insist that the potential committer demonstrate a
                    certain level of technical expertise and persistence, by submitting
                    some number of nontrivial patchesâthat is, not only do these
                    projects want to know that the person will do no harm, they want to
                    know that she is likely to do good across the code base. This isn't
                    necessarily harmful, but be careful that it doesn't start to turn
                    committership into a matter of membership in an exclusive club. The
                    question to keep in everyone's mind should be "What will bring the
                    best results for the code?" not "Will we devalue the social status
                    associated with committership by admitting this person?" The point of
                    commit access is not to reinforce people's self-worth, it's to allow
                    good changes to enter the code with a minimum of fuss. If you have
                    100 committers, 10 of whom make large changes on a regular basis, and
                    the other 90 of whom just fix typos and small bugs a few times a year,
                    that's still better than having only the 10.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Revoking Commit Access">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="revoking-committers"></a>Revoking Commit Access</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The first thing to be said about revoking commit access is: try
                    not to be in that situation in the first place. Depending on whose
                    access is being revoked, and why, the discussions around such an
                    action can be very divisive. Even when not divisive, they will be a
                    time-consuming distraction from productive work.</p>

                <p>However, if you must do it, the discussion should be had
                    privately among the same people who would be in a position to vote for
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>granting</em></span> that person whatever flavor of commit
                    access they currently have. The person himself should not be
                    included. This contradicts the usual injunction against secrecy, but
                    in this case it's necessary. First, no one would be able to speak
                    freely otherwise. Second, if the motion fails, you don't necessarily
                    want the person to know it was ever considered, because that could
                    open up questions ("Who was on my side? Who was against me?") that
                    lead to the worst sort of factionalism. In certain rare
                    circumstances, the group may want someone to know that revocation of
                    commit access is or was being considered, as a warning, but this
                    openness should be a decision the group makes. No one should ever, on
                    her own initiative, reveal information from a discussion and ballot
                    that others assumed were secret.</p>

                <p>Once someone's access is revoked, that fact is unavoidably
                    public (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#commit-access-openness" title="Avoid Mystery">the section called âAvoid
                        Mysteryâ</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so try to be as tactful as you can in
                    how it is presented to the outside world.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Partial Commit Access">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="partial-committers"></a>Partial Commit Access</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Some projects offer gradations of commit access. For example,
                    there might be contributors whose commit access gives them free rein
                    in the documentation, but who do not commit to the code itself.
                    Common areas for partial commit access include documentation,
                    translations, binding code to other programming languages,
                    specification files for packaging (e.g., RedHat RPM spec files,
                    etc.), and other places where a mistake will not result in a problem for
                    the core project.</p>

                <p>Since commit access is not only about committing, but about
                    being part of an electorate (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#electorate" title="Who Votes?">the section called âWho Votes?â</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
    <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>),
                    the question naturally arises: what can the partial committers vote
                    on? There is no one right answer; it depends on what sorts of partial
                    commit domains your project has. In Subversion things are
                    fairly simple: a partial committer can vote on matters confined
                    exclusively to that committer's domain, and not on anything else.
                    Importantly, we do have a mechanism for casting advisory votes
                    (essentially, the committer writes "+0" or "+1&nbsp;(non-binding)"
                    instead of just "+1" on the ballot). There's no reason to silence
                    people just because their vote isn't formally binding.</p>

                <p>Full committers can vote on anything, just as they can commit
                    anywhere, and only full committers vote on adding new committers of
                    any kind. In practice, though, the ability to add new partial
                    committers is usually delegated: any full committer can "sponsor" a
                    new partial committer, and partial committers in a domain can often
                    essentially choose new committers for that same domain (this is
                    especially helpful in making translation work run smoothly).</p>

                <p>Your project may need a slightly different arrangement,
                    depending on the nature of the work, but the same general principles
                    apply to all projects. Each committer should be able to vote on
                    matters that fall within the scope of her commit access, and not on
                    matters outside that, and votes on procedural questions should default
                    to the full committers, unless there's some reason (as decided by the
                    full committers) to widen the electorate. Remember that voting should
                    be rare anyway (see <a class="xref" href="#when-to-vote" title="When To Vote">the section called
                        âWhen To Voteâ</a><span> in

                <p>Regarding enforcement of partial commit access: it's often

                    enforce partial commit domains, even if it is capable of doing so.

                <p>Some projects automatically remove people's commit access if
                    they go a certain amount of time (say, a year) without committing
                    anything. I think this is usually unhelpful and even
                    counterproductive, for two reasons.</p>

                <p>First, it may tempt some people into committing acceptable but
                    unnecessary changes, just to prevent their commit access from
                    expiring. Second, it doesn't really serve any purpose. If the
                    main criterion for granting commit access is good judgement, then why
                    assume someone's judgement would deteriorate just because she's been away
                    from the project for a while? Even if she completely vanishes for
                    years, not looking at the code or following development discussions,
                    when she reappears she'll <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> how out of touch
                    she is, and act accordingly. You trusted her judgement before, so
                    why not trust it always? If high school diplomas do not expire, then
                    commit access certainly shouldn't.</p>

                <p>Sometimes a committer may ask to be removed, or to be explicitly
                    marked as dormant in the list of committers (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#commit-access-openness" title="Avoid Mystery">the section called âAvoid
                        Mysteryâ</a><span>
below</span> for more about that list). In these cases, the project
                    should accede to the person's wishes, of course.</p></div>
            <div class="sect2" title="Avoid Mystery">
                <div class="titlepage">

                </div>
                <p>Although the discussions around adding any particular new
                    committer must be confidential, the rules and procedures themselves
                    need not be secret. In fact, it's best to publish them, so people
                    realize that the committers are not some mysterious Star Chamber,
                    closed off to mere mortals, but that anyone can join simply by posting
                    good patches and knowing how to handle herself in the community.
                    In the Subversion project, we put this information right in the
                    developer guidelines document, since the people most likely to be
                    interested in how commit access is granted are those thinking of
                    contributing code to the project.</p>

                <p>In addition to publishing the procedures, publish the
                    actual <span class="emphasis"><em>list</em></span> of committers. It often goes in a
                    file called <code class="filename">MAINTAINERS</code> or
                    <code class="filename">COMMITTERS</code> or something like that, in the top
                    level of the project's source code tree. It should list all the full
                    committers first,
                    followed by the various partial commit domains and the members of each
                    domain. Each person should be listed by name and email address,
                    though the address can be encoded to prevent spam (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#address-hiding" title="Address hiding in archives">the section called
                        âAddress hiding in archivesâ</a><span> in

    <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>) if the
                    person prefers that.</p>

                <p>Since the distinction between full commit and partial commit
                    access is obvious and well defined, it is proper for the list to make
                    that distinction too. Beyond that, the list should not try to
                    indicate the informal distinctions that inevitably arise in a project,
                    such as who is particularly influential and how. It is a public
                    record, not an acknowledgments file. List committers either in
                    alphabetical order, or in the order in which they arrived.</p></div>

            <p>Credit is the primary currency of the free software world.
                Whatever people may say about their motivations for participating in a
                project, I don't know many developers who would be happy doing all
                their work anonymously, or under someone else's name. There are
                tangible reasons for this: one's reputation in a project roughly
                governs how much influence one has, and participation in an open
                source project can also indirectly have monetary value, because
                many employers now look for it on resumÃ©s<sup>[<a name="idp5277920" href="#ftn.idp5277920"
                                                                  class="footnote">64</a>]</sup>. There are also
                intangible reasons, perhaps even more powerful: people simply want to
                be appreciated, and instinctively look for signs that their work was
                recognized by others. The promise of credit is therefore one of best
                motivators the project has. When small contributions are
                acknowledged, people come back to do more.</p>

            <p>One of the most important features of collaborative development
                software (see <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure"
                                 title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Technical Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i>Technical
                    Infrastructure</i></a>) is that
                it keeps accurate records of who did what, when. Wherever possible,
                use these existing mechanisms to make sure that credit is distributed
                accurately, and be specific about the nature of the contribution.
                Don't just write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;" if
                instead you can write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;
                for the bug report and reproduction recipe" in a log message.</p>

            <p>In Subversion, we have an informal but consistent policy of
                crediting the reporter of a bug in either the ticket filed, if there
                is one, or the log message of the commit that fixes the bug, if not.
                A quick survey of Subversion commit logs up to commit number 14525
                shows that about 10% of commits give credit to someone by name and
                email address, usually the person who reported or analyzed the bug
                fixed by that commit. Note that this person is different from the
                developer who actually made the commit, whose name is already recorded
                automatically by the version control system. As of mid-2005, when I
                last did this calculation, slightly over â were credited in the
                commit logs, usually multiple times, before they became committers
                themselves. This does not, of course, prove that being credited was a
                factor in their continued involvement, but it surely can't hurt to
                set up an atmosphere in which people know they can count on their
                contributions being acknowledged.</p>

            <p>It is important to distinguish between routine acknowledgment
                and special thanks. When discussing a particular piece of code, or
                some other contribution someone made, it is fine to acknowledge their
                work. For example, saying "Daniel's recent changes to the delta code
                mean we can now implement feature X" simultaneously helps people
                identify which changes you're talking about and acknowledges Daniel's
                work. On the other hand, posting solely to thank Daniel for the delta
                code changes serves no immediate practical purpose. It doesn't add
                any information, since the version control system and other mechanisms
                have already recorded the fact that he made the changes. Thanking
                everyone for everything would be distracting and ultimately
                information-free, since thanks are effective largely by how much they
                stand out from the default, background level of favorable comment
                going on all the time. This does not mean, of course, that you should
                never thank people. Just make sure to do it in ways that tend not to
                lead to credit inflation. Following these guidelines will
                help:</p>

                    <li class="listitem"><p>The more ephemeral the forum, the more free you
                        should feel to express thanks there. For example,
                        thanking someone for their bugfix in passing during an IRC
                        conversation is fine, as is an aside in an email devoted
                        mainly to other topics. But don't post a new email solely
                        to thank someone, unless it's for a truly unusual feat, or
                        if it's just one followup in a topic-specific thread
                        already focused on the thing that person did.</p>

                        <p>Likewise, don't clutter the project's web pages with

                            <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> put thanks into comments in the

                            purpose of comments, which is to help the reader
                            understand the code.</p></li>

                        the attitude that expressing thanks is something you do
                        when someone contributes even more than you thought she
                        would. Thus, to constantly thank regular contributors for
                        doing what they normally do would be to express a lower
                        expectation of them than they have of themselves. If

                            from time to time. The canonical example is the release

                </div>
                <p>At its most basic, a <em class="firstterm">fork</em> is when one
                    copy of a project diverges from another copy: think "fork in the
                    road".</p>

                <p>What such divergence means for the project depends on the
                    intentions behind the fork. There are two types of forks, which I
                    will call <em class="firstterm">short forks</em> and <em class="firstterm">social
                        forks</em>. The distinction between them is important.</p>

                <p>Short forks are very common; in fact, they are the normal way
                    development is done in most projects today. A developer creates her
                    own public copy of the project's master repository, makes some
                    changes, then submits the changes back to the project directly from
                    the forked copy.<sup>[<a name="idp9312528" href="#ftn.idp9312528" class="footnote">65</a>]</sup>
                    Short forks are done on a routine basis as
                    part of daily development, and have no negative effect on the social
                    cohesiveness of the project.</p>

                <p>Social forks are much less common, and are much more significant
                    when they happen. A social fork is when a group of developers is
                    unhappy with the direction of the project and decides to create a
                    divergent version more in line with their own vision. Of course, one
                    of the technical actions required for such this is to create their own
                    copy of the project's repository, and perhaps of its bug database and
                    other resources as well. But this new copy of the project represents
                    a potentially permanent divergence, and developers on both sides of
                    the fork are aware of this; thus, it is a completely different beast
                    from a cooperative short fork.</p>

                <p>A social fork is almost always accompanied by long discussions
                    and rationales, in which developers try to persuade each other of the
                    merits of one or the other side of the fork, or of the merits of
                    ending the fork and reunifying. Since social forks have implications
                    for a project's stability and ability to continue attracting
                    developers, knowing how to constructively initiate or react to a
                    social fork of your project is useful&nbsp;â&nbsp;useful even if
                    a fork never happens, as understanding what leads to social forks, and
                    signalling clearly how you will behave in such an event, can sometimes
                    prevent the fork from happening in the first place.</p>

                <p>The rest of this section is about social forks, not short forks.
                    To save space, I will just use the word "fork" instead of "social
                    fork".</p></div>
            <p>In <a class="xref" href="#forkability" title="Forkability">the section called âForkabilityâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter&nbsp;4,
                <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>, we saw how
                the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span> to fork has important effects on
                how projects are governed. But what happens when a fork actually
                occurs? How should you handle it, and what effects can you expect it
                to have? Conversely, when should you <span class="emphasis"><em>initiate</em></span> a
                fork?</p>

            <p>The answers depend on what kind of fork it is. Some forks are
                due to amicable but irreconcilable disagreements about the direction
                of the project; perhaps more are due to both technical disagreements
                and interpersonal conflicts. Of course, it's not always possible to
                tell the difference between the two, as technical arguments may
                involve personal elements as well. What all forks have in common is
                that one group of developers (or sometimes even just one developer)
                has decided that the costs of working with some or all of the others
                now outweigh the benefits.</p>

            <p>Once a project forks, there is no definitive answer to the
                question of which fork is the "true" or "original" project. People
                will colloquially talk of fork F coming out of project P, as though P
                is continuing unchanged down some natural path while F diverges into
                new territory, but this is, in effect, a declaration of how that
                particular observer feels about it. It is fundamentally a matter of
                perception: when a large enough percentage of observers agree, the
                assertion starts to become true. It is not the case that there is an
                objective truth from the outset, one that we are only imperfectly able to
                perceive at first. Rather, the perceptions <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
                the objective truth, since ultimately a projectâor a
                forkâis an entity that exists only in people's minds
                anyway.</p>

            <p>If those initiating the fork feel that they are
                sprouting a new branch off the main project, the perception question
                is resolved immediately and easily. Everyone, both developers and
                users, will treat the fork as a new project, with a new name (perhaps
                based on the old name, but easily distinguishable from it), a separate
                web site, and a separate philosophy or goal. Things get messier,
                however, when both sides feel they are the legitimate guardians of the
                original project and therefore have the right to continue using the
                original name. If there is some organization with trademark rights to
                the name (see <a class="xref" href="#trademarks" title="Trademarks">the section called
                    âTrademarksâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#legal"
      title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter&nbsp;10, <i>Legal
                    Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a></span>), or legal control over the
                domain
                or web pages, that usually
                resolves the issue by fiat: that organization will decide who is the
                original project and who is the fork, because it holds all the cards in a
                public relations war. Naturally, things rarely get that far: since
                everyone already knows what the power dynamics are, they will avoid
                fighting a battle whose outcome is known in advance, and just jump
                straight to the end.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, in most cases there is little doubt as to which is
                the project and which is the fork, because a fork is, in essence, a vote
                of confidence. If more than half of the developers are in favor of
                whatever course the fork proposes to take, usually there is no need to
                forkâthe project can simply go that way itself, unless it is run
                as a dictatorship with a particularly stubborn dictator. On the other
                hand, if fewer than half of the developers are in favor, the fork is a
                clearly minority rebellion, and both courtesy and common sense
                indicate that it should think of itself as the divergent branch rather
                than the main line.</p>

            <p>When a fork occurs, there can be a question of what happens to
                non-copyable assets: not just trademarks, but perhaps money in the
                bank, hardware, that full-color conference banner sitting in a storage
                locker somewhere, etc. Sometimes, those questions are resolved
                independently of the project's decision-making procdures, because
                those assets already had formal owners, and in each case the owner
                will decide what happens to the asset. But in cases where the actual
                ownership is in dispute, or the asset belongs in some way to the
                project as a whole, there is no magic answer. If someone decides to
                make a fuss, the dispute might wind up in a court of law. In this
                respect, open source projects are not different from any other
                endeavor involving multiple people: when agreement cannot be reached
                but no one is willing to give in, the last resort is the legal system.
                It is extremely rare, however, for things to go that far in a free
                software project (I can't think of any examples, actually), because
                usually there is no participant for whom going to court is a better
                option than just giving up their side of the argument anyway.</p>

                </div>
                <p>If someone threatens a fork in your project, keep calm and
                    remember your long-term goals. The mere
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a fork isn't what hurts a project;
                    rather, it's the loss of developers and users. Your real aim,
                    therefore, is not to squelch the fork, but to minimize these harmful
                    effects. You may be mad, you may feel that the fork was unjust and
                    uncalled for, but expressing that publicly can only alienate undecided
                    developers. Instead, don't force people to make exclusive choices,
                    and be as cooperative as is practicable with the fork.</p>

                <p>Don't remove someone's commit access in your project just because she
                    decided to work on the fork. Work on the fork doesn't mean that
                    person has suddenly lost her competence to work on the original
                    project; committers before should remain committers afterward. Beyond
                    that, you should express your desire to remain as compatible as
                    possible with the fork, and say that you hope developers will port
                    changes between the two whenever appropriate. If you have
                    administrative access to the project's servers, publicly offer the
                    forkers infrastructure help at startup time. For example, offer them
                    a complete export of the bug database if there's no other way for them
                    to get it. Ask them if there's anything else
                    they need, and provide it if you can. Bend over backward to show
                    that you are not standing in the way, and that you want the fork to
                    succeed or fail on its own merits and nothing else.</p>

                <p>The reason to do all thisâand do it publiclyâis not
                    to actually help the fork, but to persuade developers that your side
                    is a safe bet, by appearing as non-vindictive as possible. In war it
                    sometimes makes sense (strategic sense, if not human sense) to force
                    people to choose sides, but in free software it almost never does. In
                    fact, after a fork some developers often openly work on both projects,
                    doing their best to keep the two compatible. These developers help
                    keep the lines of communication open after the fork. They allow your
                    project to benefit from interesting new features in the fork (yes, the
                    fork may have things you want), and also increase the chances of a
                    merger down the road.</p>

                <p>Sometimes a fork becomes so successful that, even though it was
                    regarded even by its own instigators as a fork at the outset, it
                    becomes the version everybody prefers, and eventually supplants the
                    original by popular demand. A famous instance of this was the
                    GCC/EGCS fork. The <em class="firstterm">GNU Compiler Collection</em>
                    (<em class="firstterm">GCC</em>, formerly the <em class="firstterm">GNU C
                        Compiler</em>) is the most popular open source native-code
                    compiler, and also one of the
                    most portable compilers in the world. Due to disagreements between the GCC's
                    official maintainers and Cygnus Software,<sup>[<a name="idp9335840" href="#ftn.idp9335840"
                                                                      class="footnote">66</a>]</sup> one
                    of GCC's most active developer groups, Cygnus created a fork of GCC
                    called <em class="firstterm">EGCS</em>. The fork was deliberately
                    non-adversarial: the EGCS developers did not, at any point, try to
                    portray their version of GCC as a new official version. Instead, they
                    concentrated on making EGCS as good as possible, incorporating patches
                    at a faster rate than the official GCC maintainers. EGCS grew in
                    popularity, and eventually some major operating system distributors
                    decided to package EGCS as their default compiler instead of GCC. At
                    this point, it became clear to the GCC maintainers that holding on to
                    the "GCC" name while everyone switched to the EGCS fork would burden
                    everyone with a needless name change, yet do nothing to prevent the
                    switchover. So GCC adopted the EGCS codebase, and there is once again
                    a single GCC, but greatly improved because of the fork.</p>

                <p>This example shows why you cannot always regard a fork as an
                    unadulteratedly bad thing. A fork may be painful and unwelcome at the
                    time, but you cannot necessarily know whether it will succeed.
                    Therefore, you and the rest of the project should keep an eye on it,
                    and be prepared not only to absorb features and code where possible,
                    but in the most extreme case to even join the fork if it gains the
                    bulk of the project's mindshare. Of course, you will often be able to
                    predict a fork's likelihood of success by seeing who joins it. If the
                    fork is started by the project's biggest complainer and is joined by a
                    handful of disgruntled developers who weren't behaving constructively
                    anyway, they've essentially solved a problem for you by forking, and
                    you probably don't need to worry about the fork taking momentum away
                    from the original project. But if you see influential and respected
                    developers supporting the fork, you should ask yourself why. Perhaps
                    the project was being overly restrictive, and the best solution is to
                    adopt into the mainline project some or all of the changes
                    contemplated by the forkâin essence, to avoid the fork by
                    becoming it.</p></div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>All the advice below assumes that you are forking as a last
                    resort. Exhaust all other possibilities before starting a fork.
                    Forking almost always means losing developers, with only an uncertain
                    promise of gaining new ones later. It also means starting out with
                    competition for users' attention: everyone who's about to install the
                    software has to ask themselves: "Hmm, do I want that one or the other
                    one?" Whichever one you are, the situation is messy, because a
                    question has been introduced that wasn't there before. Some people
                    maintain that forks are healthy for the software ecosystem as a whole,
                    by a standard natural selection argument: the fittest will survive,
                    which means that, in the end, everyone gets better software. This may
                    be true from the ecosystem's point of view, but it's not true from the
                    point of view of any individual project. Most forks do not succeed,
                    and most projects are not happy to be forked.</p>

                <p>A corollary is that you should not use the threat of a fork as
                    an extremist debating techniqueâ"Do things my way or I'll fork
                    the project!"âbecause everyone is aware that a fork that fails
                    to attract developers away from the original project is unlikely to
                    survive long. All observersânot just developers, but users and
                    operating system packagers tooâwill make their own judgement about
                    which side to choose. You should therefore appear extremely reluctant
                    to fork, so that if you finally do it, you can credibly claim it was
                    the only route left.</p>

                <p>Do not neglect to take <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> factors into
                    account in evaluating the potential success of your fork. For
                    example, if many of the developers on a project have the same
                    employer, then even if they are disgruntled and privately in favor of
                    a fork, they are unlikely to say so out loud if they know that their
                    employer is against it. Many free software programmers like to think
                    that having a free license on the code means no one company can
                    dominate development. It is true that the license is, in an ultimate
                    sense, a guarantor of freedom: if others want badly enough to
                    fork the project, and have the resources to do so, they can. But in
                    practice, some projects' development teams are mostly funded by one
                    entity, and there is no point pretending that the entity's support
                    doesn't matter. If it is opposed to the fork, its developers are
                    unlikely to take part, even if they secretly want to.</p>

                <p>If, after careful consideration, you still conclude that you
                    must fork, line up support
                    privately first, then announce the fork in a non-hostile tone. Even
                    if you are angry at, or disappointed with, the current maintainers,
                    don't say that in the message. Just dispassionately state what led
                    you to the decision to fork, and that you mean no ill will toward the
                    project from which you're forking. Assuming that you do consider it a
                    fork (as opposed to an emergency preservation of the original
                    project), emphasize that you're forking the code and not the name, and
                    choose a name that does not conflict with the project's name. You can
                    use a name that contains or refers to the original name, as long as it
                    does not open the door to identity confusion. Of course it's fine to
                    explain prominently on the fork's home page that it descends from the
                    original program, and even that it hopes to supplant it. Just don't
                    make users' lives harder by forcing them to untangle an identity
                    dispute.</p>

                <p>Finally, you can get things started on the right foot by
                    automatically granting <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> committers of the
                    original project commit
                    access to the fork, including even those who openly disagreed with the
                    need for a fork. Even if they never use the access, your message is
                    clear: there are disagreements here, but no enemies, and you welcome
                    code contributions from any competent source.</p></div>

                for a good counterargument, particularly the post from William Stein.
                The key in that case, I think, is that many of the authors come from a
                culture (the academic mathematics community) where crediting directly
                at the source is the norm and is highly valued. In such
                circumstances, it may be preferable to put author names into the
                source files, along with precise descriptions of what each author did,
                since the majority of potential contributors will expect that style of
                acknowledgement.</p></div>

                you've encountered this chapter while it's undergoing substantial
                revision; see <a class="ulink" href="http://producingoss.com/v2.html" target="_top">producingoss.com/v2.html</a>
                for details.</em></span></p>

            <p>It has become clear to me, partly through the consulting work I
                have done in the years since the first edition of this book, that
                organizations have particular adjustments to make when launching or
                participating in open source projects, in a way that individuals do
                not. Any organization contains formal management structures and
                informal social structures; these structures can be affected by
                engagement with open source projects, and sometimes need to be changed
                so that the organization as a whole is better able to support open
                source activity by the individuals within it. Furthermore, one kind
                of organization&nbsp;â&nbsp;government
                agencies&nbsp;â&nbsp;has special concerns when working with open
                source projects.</p>

            <p>This chapter therefore examines organizational issues generally
                and some issues specific to government agencies. Note that even if
                you're interested mainly in governments and open source, you should
                look the whole chapter, as the advice intended for organizations in
                general also applies to governments.</p></div>

            <p>This section is mainly about government agencies producing new
                open source software, and participating in existing open source
                projects; I'll also look at government usage of open source software,
                to the extent that it overlaps with those main topics.</p>

            <p>Since the first edition of this book in 2005, I've worked with
                various U.S. government agencies, at the federal, state, and municipal
                levels, to help them release open source software. I've also been
                lucky enough to observe, and in a few cases work with, some government
                agencies outside the U.S. These experiences have convinced me of one
                thing: government is different. If you work at a government agency
                and the material in this book so far has made you shake your head and
                think "Sure, but it'll never work here", you don't have to convince
                me&nbsp;â&nbsp;I already know what you mean. Governments differ
                from individuals and from private-sector organizations in some
                fundamental ways:

            </p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                    <li class="listitem">Governments often aren't trying to retain technical
                        expertise in-house (that's what contractors are for).
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem">Governments have labyrinthine and in certain ways
                        inflexible procurement and employment policies. These policies can
                        make it difficult for a government agency to be nimbly responsive in
                        an open source development community.
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem">Government agencies tend to be unusually risk-averse.
                        Somewhere at the top there's an elected official who, reasonably,
                        sees an open source project as just one more surface area for
                        opponents to attack. After all, when development happens in public,
                        the inevitable false starts and wrong turns are also public; if
                        development were internal, no one else would know about it when
                        those things happen.
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem">Government officials hunger for well-timed and
                        well-controlled publicity events. This has certain benefits, but it
                        can sometimes come at the expense of overall project health.
                        This need for publicity is the complement of being risk-averse:
                        elected officials and those who work for them understand that most
                        people aren't paying much attention most of the
                        time&nbsp;â&nbsp;therefore, those who work in government want
                        to ensure that in the few moments when people
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> paying attention, they see something
                        good. This is understandable, but it can cause them to delay
                        certain actions&nbsp;â&nbsp;or, in some cases, do them too
                        soon&nbsp;â&nbsp;based on external publicity implications
                        rather than on what's best for the project technically and

                So if you're a government agency and you want to start a successful
                open source project, certain adjustments will be necessary to
                compensate for the structural idiosyncracies above. The advice that
                follows is most applicable to the U.S. and countries with similar
                systems of government and civil service.</p>

                    explained why it's best for an open source project to be run in the
                    open from the very beginning. That advice, particularly <a class="xref"

                                                                               title="Waiting Just Creates an Exposure Event">the
                        section called âWaiting Just Creates an Exposure Eventâ</a>, is if anything even more true for
                    government code.</p>

                <p>Government projects have greater potential to be harmed by a
                    needless exposure event than private-sector projects have. Elected
                    officials and those who work for them are understandably sensitive to
                    negative public comments. Thus even for the most conscientious team,
                    a worrying cloud of uncertainty will surround everything by the time
                    you're ready to open up hitherto closed code. How can you ever know
                    you've got it all cleaned up? You do your best, but you can never be
                    totally sure some hawk-eyed hacker out there won't spot something
                    embarrassing after the release. The team worries, and worry is an
                    energy drain: it causes them to spend time chasing down ghosts, and at
                    the same time can cause them to unconsciously avoid steps that might
                    risk revealing real problems.</p>

                <p>This concern doesn't only apply to government software, of
                    course. But in the private sector, businesses sometimes have
                    competitive reasons to stay behind the curtain until their first
                    release, even if they intend for the project to be open source in the
                    long run. Government projects should not have that motivation to
                    start out closed, at least in theory, and they have even more to
                    lose.</p></div>

            <p>Legal questions have assumed a somewhat more prominent role in
                free software projects over the last decade or so. It is still the
                case that the most important things about your project are its the
                quality of its code, its features, and the health of its developer
                community. However, although all open source licenses share the same
                basic guarantees of freedom, their terms are not exactly the same in
                all details. The particular license your project uses can affect
                which entities decide to get involved in it and how. You will
                therefore need a basic understanding of free software licensing, both
                to ensure that the project's license is compatible with its goals, and
                to be able to discuss licensing decisions with others.</p>

            <p>Please note that I am not a lawyer, and that nothing in this
                book should be construed as formal legal advice. For that, you'll
                need to hire a lawyer or be one.</p></div>

            <p>In any discussion of open source licensing, the first thing that
                becomes apparent is that there seem to be many different words for the
                same thing: <em class="firstterm">free&nbsp;software</em>,
                <em class="firstterm">open&nbsp;source</em>,
                <em class="firstterm">FOSS</em>, <em class="firstterm">F/OSS</em>, and
                <em class="firstterm">FLOSS</em>. Let's start by sorting those
                out, along with a few other terms.</p>

            <div class="variablelist">
                <dl>
                    <dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">free software</em></span></dt>
                    <dd><p>Software that can be freely shared and modified,
                        including in source code form. The term was first
                        coined by Richard Stallman, who codified it in the GNU
                        General Public License (GPL), and who founded the Free
                        Software Foundation (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_top">fsf.org</a>) to
                        promote the concept.</p>

                        <p>Although "free software" covers the
                            same set of software as "open source", the FSF, among
                            others, prefers the former term because it emphasizes
                            the idea of freedom, and the concept of
                            freely redistributable software as primarily a social
                            movement rather than a technical one. The FSF
                            acknowledges that the term is ambiguousâit could
                            mean "free" as in "zero-cost", instead of "free" as in
                            "freedom"âbut feels that it's still the best term,
                            all things considered, and that the other possibilities
                            in English have their own ambiguities. (Throughout this
                            book, "free" is used in the "freedom" sense, not the
                            "zero-cost" sense.)</p></dd>

                    <dd><p>Free software under another name. The
                        different name is sometimes used to indicate a philosophical
                        difference, however. In fact, the term "open source"
                        was coined by the group that founded the Open Source
                        Initiative (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/" target="_top">opensource.org</a>)
                        as a deliberate alternative to "free software". Their
                        goal at the time was largely to make such software a
                        more palatable choice for
                        corporations, by presenting it as a development
                        methodology rather than as a political
                        movement.<sup>[<a name="idp9750560" href="#ftn.idp9750560" class="footnote">67</a>]</sup></p>

                        <p>While any license that is free is also open
                            source, and vice versa (with a few minor exceptions that
                            have no practical consequences),
                            people tend to pick one term and stick with it. In
                            general, those who prefer "free software" are more
                            likely to have a philosophical or moral stance on the
                            issue, while those who prefer "open source" either don't
                            view it as a matter of freedom, or are not interested in
                            advertising the fact that they do. See

                        be three, and that is exactly what is happening with
                        terms for free software. The academic world, perhaps
                        wanting precision and inclusiveness over elegance, seems
                        to have settled on FOSS, or sometimes F/OSS, standing
                        for "Free / Open Source Software". Another variant
                        gaining momentum is FLOSS, which
                        stands for "Free / Libre Open Source Software"

                        <p>All these terms mean the same thing:

                        (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines" target="_top">debian.org/social_contract#guidelines</a>).
                        This is a widely-used test for whether a given license
                        is truly open source
                        (free, <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">libre</em></span>, etc.). The
                        Debian Project's mission is to maintain an entirely free
                        operating system, such that someone installing it need
                        never doubt that she has the right to modify and
                        redistribute any or all of the system. The Debian Free
                        Software Guidelines are the requirements that a software
                        package's license must meet in order to be included in
                        Debian. Because the Debian Project spent a good deal of
                        time thinking about how to construct such a test, the
                        guidelines they came up with have proven very robust
                        (see <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG" target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG</a>),
                        and as far as I'm aware, no serious objection to them has
                        been raised either by the Free Software Foundation or
                        the Open Source Initiative. If you know that a given
                        license is DFSG-compliant, you know that it guarantees
                        all the important freedoms (such as forkability even
                        against the original author's wishes) required to
                        sustain the dynamics of an open source project. Since
                        2004, the Debian Project has maintained a list of known
                        DFSG-compliant licenses at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses"

                        licenses
                        discussed in this chapter are DFSG-compliant.</p></dd>

                    <dd><p>Approved by the Open Source Initiative. This is
                        another widely-used test of whether a license permits
                        all the necessary freedoms. The OSI's definition of
                        open source software is based on the Debian Free
                        Software Guidelines, and any license that meets one
                        definition almost always meets the other. There have
                        been a few exceptions over the years, but only involving
                        niche licenses and none of any relevance here. The OSI
                        maintains a list of all
                        licenses it has ever approved, at
                        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/" target="_top">opensource.org/licenses/</a>,
                        so
                        that being "OSI-approved" is an unambiguous state: a
                        license either is or isn't on the list.</p>

                        <p>The Free Software Foundation also maintains a list
                            of licenses at <a class="ulink"

                            The FSF categorizes licenses not only by whether they
                            are free, but whether they are compatible with the GNU
                            General Public License. GPL compatibility is an
                            important topic, covered in

                    <dd><p>The opposite of "free" or "open source." It means
                        software distributed under traditional, royalty-based
                        licensing terms, where users pay per copy, or under any
                        other terms sufficiently restrictive to prevent open
                        source dynamics from operating. Even software
                        distributed at no charge can still be proprietary, if
                        its license does not permit free redistribution and
                        modification.</p>

                        <p>Generally "proprietary" and "closed-source" are
                            synonyms. However, "closed-source" additionally implies
                            that the source code cannot even be seen. Since the
                            source code cannot be seen with most proprietary
                            software, this is normally a distinction without a
                            difference. However, occasionally someone releases
                            proprietary software under a license that allows others
                            to view the source code. Confusingly, they sometimes
                            call this "open source" or "nearly open source," etc.,
                            but that's misleading. The
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>visibility</em></span> of the source code is
                            not the issue; the important question is what you're
                            allowed to do with it: if you can't copy, modify, and
                            redistribute, then it's not open source. Thus, the
                            difference between proprietary and closed-source is
                            mostly irrelevant; generally, the two can be treated
                            as synonyms.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes <em class="firstterm">commercial</em> is
                            used as a synonym for "proprietary," but this is
                            carelessness: the two are not the same. Free software
                            is always commercial software. After all, free software
                            can be sold, as long as the buyers are not restricted
                            from giving away copies themselves. It can be
                            commercialized in other ways as well, for example by
                            selling support, services, and certification. There are
                            billion-dollar companies built on free software
                            today, so it is clearly neither inherently
                            anti-commercial nor anti-corporate. It is merely
                            anti-proprietary, or if you prefer anti-monopolistic,
                            and this is the key way in which it differs from
                            per-copy license models.</p></dd>

                    <dd><p>Having no copyright holder, meaning that there is
                        no one who has the right to restrict copying of the

                        having no author. Everything has an author, and even if a
                        work's author or authors choose to put it in the public
                        domain, that doesn't change the fact that they wrote
                        it.</p>

                        <p>When a work is in the public domain, material from
                            it can be incorporated into a copyrighted work, and the
                            derivative is thus under the same overall copyright as
                            the original copyrighted work. But this does not affect
                            the availability of the original public domain wok.
                            Thus, releasing something into the public domain is
                            technically one way to make it "free," according to the
                            guidelines of most free software certifying
                            organizations (see <a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.org/faq#public-domain"

                            However, there are usually good reasons to use a license
                            instead of just releasing into the public domain: even
                            with free software, certain terms and conditions can be
                            useful, not only to the copyright holder but to
                            recipients as well, as the next section makes clear.</p></dd>

                        Trademark-protecting licenses specify that the name of
                        the original software (or its copyright holders, or
                        their institution, etc.) may <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
                        used to identify derivative works, at least not without
                        prior written permission. This restriction can be
                        implemented purely via trademark law anyway, whether or
                        not it is also stipulated by the copyright license, so
                        such clauses can be somewhat legally
                        redundant&nbsp;â&nbsp;in effect, they amplify a
                        trademark infringement into a copyright infringement as
                        well.</p>

                            not be used, they are both expressions of the same
                            concept: that the original code's reputation be
                            preserved, and not tarnished by association.</p></dd>

                        language designed
                        to prevent people from using patent law to take away the

                        clearly between the pristine original version of the

                        requirements that make the integrity of the original

            <p>The sharpest dividing line in licensing is that between
                proprietary-incompatible and proprietary-compatible licenses, that is,
                between the copyleft licenses and everything else. The canonical
                example of a copyleft license is the GNU General Public License (along
                with its network-oriented variant, the Affero GNU General Public
                License or AGPL, introduced later in this chapter in <a class="xref" href="#gnu-affero-gpl"
                                                                        title="The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code">the
                    section called âThe GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Codeâ</a>), and one of
                the most important
                considerations in choosing the GPL or AGPL is the extent to which it
                is compatible with other licenses. For brevity, I'll refer just to
                the GPL below, but most of this applies to the AGPL as well.</p>

            <p>Because the primary goal of the GPL's authors is the promotion
                of free software, they deliberately crafted the license to make it
                impossible to mix GPLed code into proprietary programs. Specifically,
                among the GPL's requirements (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html"
                                                     target="_top">fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html</a> for its full
                text) are
                these two:</p>

            <div class="orderedlist">
                <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                    <li class="listitem"><p>Any derivative workâthat is, any work
                        containing a nontrivial amount of GPLed codeâmust
                        itself be distributed under the GPL.</p></li>
                    <li class="listitem"><p>No additional restrictions may be placed on the
                        redistribution of either the original work or a derivative
                        work. (The exact language is: "You may not impose any
                        further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
                        or affirmed under this License.")</p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>With these conditions, the GPL succeeds in making freedom
                contagious. Once a program is copyrighted under the GPL, its terms of
                redistribution are
                <em class="firstterm">reciprocal</em><sup>[<a name="idp9834112" href="#ftn.idp9834112" class="footnote">68</a>]</sup>âthey
                are passed
                on to anything else the code gets incorporated into, making it
                effectively impossible to use GPLed code in closed-source programs.
                However, these same clauses also make the GPL incompatible with
                certain other free licenses. The usual way this happens is that the
                other license imposes a requirementâfor example, a credit clause
                requiring the original authors to be mentioned in some wayâthat
                is incompatible with the GPL's "You may not impose any further
                restrictions..." language. From the point of view of the Free
                Software Foundation, these second-order consequences are desirable, or
                at least not regrettable. The GPL not only keeps your software free,
                but effectively makes your software an agent in pushing
                <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> software to enforce freedom as well.</p>

            <p>The question of whether or not this is a good way to
                promote free software is one of the most persistent holy wars on the
                Internet (see <a class="xref" href="#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">the section called âAvoid Holy
                    Warsâ</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6,
                    <i>Communications</i></a></span>), and we won't
                investigate it here. What's important for our purposes is that
                GPL compatibility is something to consider when choosing a license. The
                GPL is by far the most popular open source license, having more than
                twice as many projects released under it as under the next most
                popular licenses<sup>[<a name="idp9839136" href="#ftn.idp9839136" class="footnote">69</a>]</sup>.
                If you want your code to be able to be
                mixed freely with GPLed codeâand there's a lot of GPLed code out
                thereâthen you should pick a GPL-compatible license. Most of
                the GPL-compatible open source licenses are also
                proprietary-compatible: that is, code under such a license can be used
                in a GPLed program, and it can be used in a proprietary program. Of
                course, the <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span> of these mixings would not be
                compatible with each other, since one would be under the GPL and the
                other would be under a closed-source license. But that concern
                applies only to the derivative works, not to the code you distribute
                in the first place.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, the Free Software Foundation maintains a list
                showing which licenses are compatible with the GPL and which are not,
                at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html" target="_top">gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>.
                All
                of the licenses discussed in this chapter are present on that list, on
                one side or the other.</p></div>

            <p>When choosing a license to apply to your project, use an
                existing license instead of making up a new one. And don't just use
                any existing license&nbsp;â&nbsp;use one of the widely-used,
                well-recognized existing licenses.</p>

            <p>Such licenses are familiar to many people already. If you use
                one of them, people won't feel they have to read the legalese in order
                to use your code, because they'll have already done so for that
                license a long time ago. Thus, you reduce or remove one possible
                barrier to entry for your project. They are also of a high quality:
                they are the products of much thought and experience; indeed most
                of them are revisions of previous versions of themselves, and the
                modern versions represent a great deal of accumulated legal and
                technical wisdom. Unless your project has truly unusual needs, it is
                unlikely you could do better, even with a team of lawyers at your
                disposal.</p>

            <p>Below is a list of licenses that in my opinion meets these
                criteria; in parentheses are the standard formal abbreviation for the
                license and an authoritative URL for its full text. This list is not
                in order of preference, but rather in roughly descending order from
                strong copyleft at the top to completely non-copyleft at the bottom.
                The exact provisions of each license differ in various interesting
                ways (except for MIT and BSD, which differ only in uninteresting
                ways), and there isn't space here to explore all the possible
                ramifications of each for your project. However, many good
                discussions of that sort are available on the Internet; in particular
                the Wikipedia pages for these licenses generally give good
                overviews.</p>

            <p>If you have nothing else to guide you and you want a copyleft
                license, then choose either the GPL-3.0 or the
                AGPL-3.0&nbsp;â&nbsp;the difference between them will be
                discussed below&nbsp;â&nbsp;and if you want a non-copyleft
                license, choose the MIT license. I've put those licenses in boldface
                to reflect this:</p>

                favor of MIT because it is extremely short, and both widely used and
                widely recognized<sup>[<a name="idp9864752" href="#ftn.idp9864752" class="footnote">70</a>]</sup>. While
                the
                Apache License 2.0 has the advantage of containing some explicit
                defenses against misuse of software patents, which might be important
                to your organization depending on the kind of project you're
                launching, the MIT license is fully compatible with all versions of
                the GNU General Public License, meaning that you can distributed,
                under any version of the GPL, mixed-provenance works that contain
                MIT-licensed code. The GPL-compatibility situation for the Apache
                License, on the other hand, is more complicated&nbsp;â&nbsp;by
                some interpretations, it is compatible with GPL version 3 only.
                Therefore, to avoid giving your downstream redistributors the headache
                of having to read sentences like the preceding ones, I just recommend
                the MIT license as the default non-copyleft license for anyone who
                doesn't have a reason to choose otherwise.</p>

                <p>If you prefer that your project's code not be used in

                    can be used in proprietary programs, the GNU General Public License is
                    a good choice.</p>

                <p>When writing a code library that is meant mainly to be used as
                    part of other programs, consider carefully whether the restrictions
                    imposed by the GPL are in line with your project's goals. In some
                    casesâfor example, when you're trying to unseat a competing,
                    proprietary library that offers the same functionalityâit may
                    make more strategic sense to license your code in such a way that it
                    can be mixed into proprietary programs, even though you would
                    otherwise not wish this. The Free Software Foundation even fashioned
                    an alternative to the GPL for such circumstances: the <em class="firstterm">GNU

                    The LGPL has looser restrictions than the GPL,
                    and can be mixed more easily with non-free code. The FSF's page about
                    the LGPL, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_top">gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a>,

                    <p>In 2007, the Free Software Foundation released a variant of the

                        Its purpose is to bring
                        copyleft-style sharing provisions to the increasing amount of code
                        being run as hosted services&nbsp;â&nbsp;that is, software that
                        runs "in the cloud" on remote servers, that users interact with only
                        over the network, and that therefore is never directly distributed to
                        users as executable or source code. Many such services use GPL'd
                        software, often with extensive modifications, yet could avoid
                        publishing their changes because they weren't actually distributing
                        code.</p>

                    <p>The AGPL's solution to this was to take the GPL and add a
                        "Remote Network Interaction" clause, stating "<span class="emphasis"><em>...if you
                            modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all
                            users interacting with it remotely through a computer network ... an
                            opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version ... at
                            no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
                            copying of software.</em></span>" This expanded the GPL's enforcement
                        powers into the new world of application service providers. The Free
                        Software Foundation recommends that the GNU AGPL 3.0 be used for any
                        software that will commonly be run over a network.</p>

                    <p>Note that the AGPL-3.0 is not directly compatible with GPL-2.0,
                        though it is compatible with GPL-3.0. Since most software licensed
                        under GPL-2.0 includes the "or any later version" clause anyway, that
                        software can just be shifted to GPL-3.0 if and when you need to mix it
                        with AGPL-3.0 code. However, if you need to mix with programs
                        licensed strictly under the GPL-2.0 (that is, programs licensed
                        without the "or any later version" clause), the AGPL3.0 wouldn't be
                        compatible with that.</p>

                    <p>Although the history of the AGPL-3.0 is a bit complicated, the
                        license itself is simple: it's just the GPL-3.0 with one extra clause
                        about network interaction. The Wikipedia article on the AGPL is
                        excellent: <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License"

                    </div>
                    <p>One consequence of choosing the GPL (or AGPL) is the
                        possibilityâsmall, but not infinitely smallâof finding
                        yourself or your project embroiled in a dispute about whether or not
                        the GPL is truly "free", given that it places some restrictions on
                        how you redistribute the codeânamely, the restriction that the
                        code cannot be distributed under any other license. For some people,
                        the existence of this restriction means the GPL is therefore "less
                        free" than non-copyleft licenses. Where this
                        argument usually goes, of course, is that since "more free" must be
                        better than "less free" (after all, who's not in favor of freedom?),
                        it follows that those licenses are better than the GPL.</p>

                    <p>This debate is another popular holy war (see
                        <a class="xref" href="#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">the section called âAvoid Holy
                            Warsâ</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>).
                        Avoid participating
                        in it, at least in project forums. Don't attempt to prove that the
                        GPL is less free, as free, or more free than other licenses. Instead,
                        emphasize the specific reasons your project chose the GPL. If the
                        recognizability of license was a reason, say that. If the enforcement
                        of a free license on derivative works was also a reason, say that too,
                        but refuse to be drawn into discussion about whether this makes the
                        code more or less "free". Freedom is a complex topic, and there is
                        little point talking about it if terminology is going to be used as a
                        stalking horse for substance.</p>

                    <p>Since this is a book and not a mailing list thread, however, I
                        will admit that I've never understood the "GPL is not free" argument.
                        The only restriction the GPL imposes is that it prevents people from
                        imposing <span class="emphasis"><em>further</em></span> restrictions. To say that this
                        results in less freedom has always seemed to me like saying that
                        outlawing slavery reduces freedom, because it prevents some people
                        from owning slaves.</p>

                    <p>(Oh, and if you do get drawn into a debate about it, don't raise
                        the stakes by making inflammatory analogies.)</p></div>

            <p>There are three ways to handle copyright ownership for free code
                and documentation that were contributed to by many people. The first
                is to ignore the issue of copyright entirely (I don't recommend this).
                The second is to collect a <em class="firstterm">contributor license
                    agreement</em> (<em class="firstterm">CLA</em>) from each person
                who works on the project, explicitly granting the project the right to
                use that person's contributions. This is usually enough for most
                projects, and the nice thing is that in some jurisdictions, CLAs can
                be sent in by email. The third way is to get actual
                <em class="firstterm">copyright assignment</em> (<em class="firstterm">CA</em>
                from contributors, so that the project (i.e., some legal entity,
                usually a nonprofit) is the copyright owner for everything. This way
                is the most burdensome for contributors, and some contributors simply
                refuse to do it; only a few projects still ask for assignment, and I don't
                recommend that any project require it these days.<sup>[<a name="idp9906704" href="#ftn.idp9906704"

                open source licenses do not give the copyright holder the right to
                retroactively proprietize all copies of the code. So even if the
                project, as a legal entity, were to suddenly turn around and start
                distributing all the code under a restrictive license, that wouldn't
                cause a problem for the public community. The other developers would
                simply start a fork based on the latest free copy of the code, and
                continue as if nothing had happened.</p>

                <p>Most projects never collect CLAs or CAs from
                    their contributors. Instead, they accept code whenever it seems
                    reasonably clear that the contributor intended it to be incorporated
                    into the project.</p>

                <p>Under normal circumstances, this is okay. But every now and
                    then, someone may decide to sue for copyright infringement, alleging
                    that they are the true owner of the code in question and that they
                    never agreed to its being distributed by the project under an open
                    source license. For example, the SCO Group did something like this to
                    the Linux project, see
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies" target="_top">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies</a>
                    for details. When this happens, the project will have no
                    documentation showing that the contributor formally granted the right
                    to use the code, which could make some legal defenses more
                    difficult.</p></div>

                <p>CLAs probably offer the best tradeoff between safety and
                    convenience. A CLA is typically an electronic form that a developer
                    fills out and sends in to the project. In many jurisdictions, email
                    submission or an online form is enough. A secure digital signature
                    may or may not be required; consult a lawyer to find out what method
                    would be best for `your project.</p>

                <p>Most projects use two slightly different CLAs, one for
                    individuals, and one for corporate contributors. But in both types,
                    the core language is the same: the contributor grants the
                    project a <span class="emphasis"><em>"...perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                        royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
                        derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
                        and distribute [the] Contributions and such derivative
                        works."</em></span> Again, you should have a lawyer approve any CLA,
                    but if you get all those adjectives into it, you're off to a good start.</p>

                <p>When you request CLAs from contributors, make sure to emphasize
                    that you are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> asking for actual copyright
                    assignment. In fact, many CLAs start out by reminding the reader of
                    this:</p>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This is a license agreement only; it

                        Relicensing Schemes</h2></div>

            <a name="dual-licensing"></a>

            <p>Some companies offer open source code with a
                <em class="firstterm">proprietary relicensing</em>
                scheme<sup>[<a name="idp9931264" href="#ftn.idp9931264" class="footnote">75</a>]</sup>, in which an open
                source version of the
                software is available under the usual open source terms, while a
                proprietary version is available for a fee.</p>

            <p>Why would anyone want a proprietary version, when an open source
                version is already out there? There are two separate answers,
                reflecting the two different types of proprietary relicensing.</p>

            <p>The first kind is about <em class="firstterm">selling
                exceptions</em> to copyleft requirements, and is typically used
                with code libraries rather than with standalone applications. The way
                it works is that the library's owner (i.e., copyright holder), seeing
                that some of the library's users want to incorporate it into their own
                proprietary applications, sells them a promise to
                <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> enforce the redistribution requirements of
                the open source version's license. This only works when the open
                source code is under a copyleft-style license, of
                course&nbsp;â&nbsp;in practice it is usually the GPL or
                AGPL.</p>

            <p>With this promise in hand, the downstream users can use the
                library in their proprietary product without worry that they might be
                forced to share the source code to the full product under the copyleft
                license. One well-known example of "selling exceptions" is the MySQL
                database engine, which is distributed under the GPL version 2, but
                with a proprietary license offering available for many years, first
                from the Swedish company MySQL AB, and later from Oracle, Inc, which
                purchased MySQL AB in 2008.</p>

            <p>The second kind of proprietary relicensing, sometimes called the
                <em class="firstterm">freemium</em> model, uses an open source version to
                drive sales of a presumably fancier proprietary version. Usually the
                company offering the proprietary version is also the primary
                maintainer of the open source version, in the sense of supplying most
                of the developer attention (this is usually inevitable, for reasons
                we'll get to in a moment). Furthermore, although in theory the
                company <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> offer paid support for both the
                open source and proprietary versions, in practice they almost
                always offer it only for the proprietary version, because then they
                can charge two fees: a subscription fee for the software itself and a
                fee for the support services, with only the latter having any marginal
                cost to the supplier.</p>

            <p>You might be wondering: how can the copyright holder offer the
                software under a proprietary license if the terms of the GNU GPL
                stipulate that the code must be available under less restrictive
                terms? The answer is that the GPL's terms are something the copyright
                holder imposes on everyone else; the owner is therefore free to decide
                <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to apply those terms to itself. In other
                words, one always has the right to not sue one's self for copyright
                infringement. This right is not tied to the GPL or any other open
                source license; it is simply in the nature of copyright law.</p>

                            Relicensing</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Proprietary relicensing, of both varieties, tends to suffer from
                    several problems.</p>

                <p>First, it discourages the normal dynamics of open source
                    projects, because any code contributors from outside the company are
                    now effectively contributing to two distinct entities: the free
                    version of the code and the proprietary version. While the
                    contributor will be comfortable helping the free version, since that's
                    the norm in open source projects, she may feel less enthusiastic about
                    her contributions being useable in a monopolized proprietary product.
                    That is, unlike a straight non-copyleft license by which anyone has
                    the right to use the code as part of a proprietary work, here only
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> party has that right, and other participants
                    in the project are thus being asked to contribute to an asymmetric
                    result. This awkwardness is reflected and in some ways amplified by
                    the fact that in a proprietary relicensing scheme, the copyright owner
                    must collect some kind of formal agreement from each contributor (see
                    <a class="xref" href="#contributor-agreements" title="Contributor Agreements">the section called
                        âContributor Agreementsâ</a> earlier in this chapter), in
                    order to have the right to redistribute that contributor's code under
                    a proprietary license. Because such an agreement needs to give the
                    collecting entity special, one-sided rights that a typical open source
                    contributor agreement doesn't include, the process of collecting
                    agreements starkly confronts contributors with the imbalance of the
                    situation, and some of them may decline to sign. (Remember, they
                    don't need to sign a contribution agreement in order to distribute
                    their own changes along with the original code; rather, the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>company</em></span> needs the agreement in order to
                    redistribute the contributor's changes, especially under a proprietary
                    license. Asymmetry cuts both ways.)</p>

                <p>Historically, many companies that have started out offering a
                    seemingly clear proprietary relicensing option&nbsp;â&nbsp;use
                    our product under open source terms, or buy a proprietary license so
                    you can use it under proprietary terms&nbsp;â&nbsp;eventually
                    graduated to something closer to a "shakedown" model instead, in which
                    anyone who makes commercially significant use of the code ends up
                    being pressured to purchase a proprietary license as a way of
                    protecting their commercial revenue stream from harassment. The
                    precise legal bases on which this pressure rests differ from case to
                    case, but the overall pattern of behavior has been remarkably
                    consistent.</p>

                <p>Naturally, neither the companies initiating these shakedowns nor
                    the parties who are its targets, most of whom eventually capitulate,
                    have anything to gain from going on the record about it, so I can only
                    tell you that I have heard of it informally and off-the-record from
                    multiple developers, at different projects and different companies.
                    One reason I generally advise companies who are serious about open
                    source development to stay away from proprietary relicensing is that,
                    if history is a reliable guide, the temptation to undermine the open
                    source license will be overwhelming to the point of being impossible
                    to resist.</p>

                <p>Finally, there is a deep motivational problem for open source
                    projects that operate in the shadow of a proprietarily relicensed
                    version: the sense that most of the salaried development attention is
                    going to the proprietary version anyway, and that therefore spending
                    time contributing to the open source version is a fool's
                    game&nbsp;â&nbsp;that one is just helping a commercial entity
                    free up its own developers to work on features that the open source
                    community will never see. This fear is reasonable on its face, but it
                    also becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more outside developers
                    stay away, the company sees less reason to invest in the open source
                    code base, because they're not getting a community multiplier effect
                    anyway. Their disengagement in turn discourages outside developers,
                    and so on.</p>

                <p>What seems to happen in practice is that companies that offer
                    proprietarily relicensed software do not get truly active development
                    communities with external participants. They get occasional
                    small-scale bug fixes and cleanup patches from the outside, but end up
                    doing most of the hard work with internal resources. Since this book
                    is about running free software projects, I will just say that in my
                    experience, proprietary relicensing schemes inevitably have a negative
                    effect on the level of community engagement and the level of technical
                    quality on the open source side. If you conclude that for business
                    reasons you want to try it anyway, then I hope this section will at
                    least help you mitigate some of those effects.</p></div>

            <p>Trademark law as applied to open source projects does not differ
                significantly from trademark law as applied elsewhere. This sometimes
                surprises people: they think that if the code can be copied freely,
                then that can't possibly be consistent with some entity controlling a
                trademark on the project's name or logo. It is consistent, however,
                and below I'll explain why, furnishing some examples.</p>

            <p>First, understand what trademarks are about: they are about
                truth in labeling and, to some degree, endorsement. A trademarked
                name or symbol is a way for an entity&nbsp;â&nbsp;the entity who
                owns or controls that trademark&nbsp;â&nbsp;to signal, in an
                easily recognizeable way, that they approve of a particular product.
                Often they are signaling their approval because they are the source of
                the product, and purchases of that product provide a revenue stream
                for them. But that is not the only circumstance under which someone
                might want to enforce accurate attribution. For example,
                certification marks are trademarked names or symbols that an entity
                applies to <span class="emphasis"><em>someone else's</em></span> product, in order to
                signal that the product meets the certifying entity's
                standards.</p>

            <p>Importantly, <span class="emphasis"><em>trademarks do not restrict copying,
                modification, or redistribution</em></span>. I cannot emphasize this
                enough: trademark is unrelated to copyright, and does not govern the
                same actions that copyright governs. Trademark is about what you may
                publicly call things, not about what you may do with those things nor
                with whom you may share them.</p>

            <p>One famous example of trademark enforcement in free and open
                source software demonstrates these distinctions clearly.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Case study: Mozilla Firefox, the Debian Project, and Iceweasel">
                <div class="titlepage">
                    <div>
                        <div><h3 class="title"><a name="mozilla-firefox-debian-iceweasel"></a>Case study: Mozilla
                            Firefox, the Debian Project, and Iceweasel</h3></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The Mozilla Foundation owns the trademarked name "Firefox",
                    which it uses to refer to its popular free software web browser of the
                    same name. The Debian Project, which maintains a long-running and
                    also quite popular GNU/Linux distribution, wanted to package Firefox
                    for users of Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

                <p>So far, so good: Debian does not need Mozilla's permission to
                    package Firefox, since Firefox is open source software. However,
                    Debian does need Mozilla's permission to <span class="emphasis"><em>call</em></span> the
                    packaged browser "Firefox" and to use the widely-recognized Firefox
                    logo (you've probably seen it: a long reddish fox curling its body and
                    tail around a blue globe) as the icon for the program, because those
                    are trademarks owned by Mozilla.</p>

                <p>Normally, Mozilla would have happily given its permission.
                    After all, having Firefox distributed in Debian is good for Mozilla's
                    mission of promoting openness on the Web. However, various technical
                    and policy effects of the Debian packaging process left Debian unable
                    to fully comply with Mozilla's trademark usage requirements, and as a
                    result, Mozilla informed Debian that their Firefox package could not
                    use the Firefox name or branding. No doubt Mozilla did so with some
                    reluctance, as it is not ideal for them to have their software used
                    without clear attribution. However, they could have given Debian a
                    trademark license and yet chose not to; presumably, this is because
                    Debian was doing something with the code that Mozilla did not want
                    accruing to their own reputation.<sup>[<a name="idp9959536" href="#ftn.idp9959536" class="footnote">76</a>]</sup>
                </p>

                <p>This decision by Mozilla did not mean that Debian had to remove
                    Firefox from their package system, of course. Debian simply changed
                    the name to "Iceweasel" and used a different logo. The underlying
                    code is still the Mozilla Firefox code, except for the minor bits
                    Debian had to change to integrate the different name and
                    logo&nbsp;â&nbsp;changes they were perfectly free to make, of
                    course, because of the code's open source license.</p></div>
            <p>It is even consistent to license your project's logo artwork
                files under a fully free license while still retaining a trademark on
                the logo, as the following story of the GNOME logo and the fish
                pedicure shop (I'm not making this up) illustrates.</p>

            <div class="sect2" title="Case study: The GNOME Logo and the Fish Pedicure Shop">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://gnome.org/" target="_top">GNOME Project</a>, which
                    produces one of the major free software desktop environments, is
                    represented legally by the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnome.org/foundation/" target="_top">GNOME
                        Foundation</a>,
                    which owns and enforces trademarks on behalf of the project. Their
                    best-known trademark is the GNOME logo: a curved, stylized foot with
                    four toes floating close above it.<sup>[<a name="idp9966000" href="#ftn.idp9966000"
                                                               class="footnote">77</a>]</sup></p>

                <p>One day, Karen Sandler, then the Executive Director of the GNOME
                    Foundation, heard from a GNOME contributor that a mobile fish-pedicure
                    van (fish pedicure is a technique in which one places one's feet in
                    water so that small fish can nibble away dead skin) was using a
                    modified version of the GNOME logo. The central foot part of the
                    image had been slightly modified to look like a fish, and a fifth toe
                    had been added above, so that the overall logo looked even more like a
                    human foot but cleverly made reference to fish as well. You can see
                    it, along with discussion of other trademark issues GNOME has dealt
                    with, in the Linux Weekly News article where this story is told in
                    full: <a class="ulink" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/491639/"
                             target="_top">lwn.net/Articles/491639</a>.</p>

                <p>Although GNOME does actively enforce its trademarks, Sandler did
                    not see any infringement in this case: the fish-pedicure business is
                    so distant from what the GNOME Project does that there was no
                    possibility of confusion in the mind of the public or dilution (if
                    you'll pardon the expression) of the mark. Furthermore, because the
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span> license on GNOME's images is an open
                    source license, the fish pedicure company was free to make their
                    modifications to the graphic and display the results. There was no
                    trademark violation, because there was no infringement within GNOME's
                    domain of activity, and there was no copyright violation, because
                    GNOME's materials are released under free licenses.</p></div>
            <p>The point of these examples is to merely show that there is no
                inherent contradiction in registering and maintaining trademarks
                related to open source projects. This does not mean that a trademark
                owner should do whatever they want with the marks, ignoring what other
                participants in the project have to say. Trademarks are like any
                other centrally-controlled resource: if you use them in a way that
                harms a significant portion of the project's community, then expect
                complaints and pushback in return; if you use them in a way that
                supports the goals of the project, then most participants will be glad
                and will consider that use to be itself a form of contribution.</p></div>

            </div>
            <p>Software patents have long been a lightning rod issue in
                free software, because they pose the only real threat against which
                the free software community cannot defend itself. Copyright and
                trademark problems can always be gotten around. If part of your code
                looks like it may infringe on someone else's copyright, you can just
                rewrite that part while continuing to use the same underlying
                algorithm. If it turns out someone has a trademark on your
                project's name, at the very worst you can just rename the project.
                Although changing names would be a temporary inconvenience, it
                wouldn't matter in the long run, since the code itself would still do
                what it always did.</p>

            <p>But a patent is a blanket injunction against implementing a
                certain idea. It doesn't matter who writes the code, nor even what
                programming language is used. Once someone has accused a free
                software project of infringing a patent, the project must either stop
                implementing that particular feature, or expose the project
                <span class="emphasis"><em>and its users</em></span> to expensive and
                time-consuming lawsuits. Since the instigators of such lawsuits are
                usually corporations with deep pocketsâthat's who has the
                resources and inclination to acquire patents in the first
                placeâmost free software projects cannot afford either to defend
                themselves nor to indemnify their users, and must capitulate
                immediately even if they think it
                highly likely that the patent would be unenforceable in court. To
                avoid getting into such a situation in the first place, free software
                projects have sometimes had to code defensively, avoiding patented
                algorithms in advance even when they are the best or only available
                solution to a programming problem.</p>

            <p>Surveys and anecdotal evidence show that not only the vast
                majority of open source programmers, but a majority
                of <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> programmers, think that software patents
                should be abolished entirely.<sup>[<a name="idp9977936" href="#ftn.idp9977936" class="footnote">78</a>]</sup>
                Open source programmers tend to feel
                particularly strongly about it, and may refuse to work on projects
                that are too closely associated with the collection or enforcement of
                software patents. If your organization collects software patents,
                then make it clear, in a public and irrevocable way, that the patents
                would never be enforced when the infringement comes from open source
                code, and that the patents are
                only to be used as a defense in case some other party initiates an
                infringement suit against your organization. This is not only the
                right thing to do, it's also good open source public relations.<sup>[<a name="idp9979888"
                                                                                        href="#ftn.idp9979888"
                                                                                        class="footnote">79</a>]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, collecting patents purely for defensive purposes
                is rational. The current patent system, at least in the United
                States, is by its nature an arms race: if your competitors have
                acquired a lot of patents, then your best defense is to acquire a lot
                of patents yourself, so that if you're ever hit with a patent
                infringement suit you can respond with a similar threatâthen the
                two parties usually sit down and work out a cross-licensing deal so
                that neither of them has to pay anything, except to their patent
                lawyers of course.</p>

            <p>The harm done to free software by software patents is more
                insidious than just direct threats to code development, however.
                Software patents encourage an atmosphere of secrecy among firmware
                designers, who justifiably worry that by publishing details of their
                interfaces they will be making it easier for competitors to find ways
                to slap them with patent infringement suits. This is not just a
                theoretical danger; it has apparently been happening for a long time
                in the video card industry, for example. Many video card
                manufacturers are reluctant to release the detailed programming
                specifications needed to produce high-performance open source drivers
                for their cards, thus making it impossible for free operating systems
                to support those cards to their full potential. Why would the
                manufacturers withold these specs? It doesn't make sense for them to
                work <span class="emphasis"><em>against</em></span> software support; after all,
                compatibility with more operating systems can only mean more card
                sales. But it turns out that, behind the design room door, these
                shops are all violating one another's patents, sometimes knowingly and
                sometimes accidentally. The patents are so unpredictable and so
                potentially broad that no card manufacturer can ever be certain it's
                safe, even after doing a patent search. Thus, manufacturers dare not
                publish their full interface specifications, since that would make it
                much easier for competitors to figure out whether any patents are
                being infringed. (Of course, the nature of this situation is such
                that you will not find a written admission from a primary source that
                it is going on; I learned it through a personal communication.)</p>

            <p>Modern free software licenses generally have clauses to combat,
                or at least mitigate, the dangers arising from software patents.
                Usually these clauses work by automatically revoking the overall open
                source license for any party who makes a patent infringement claim
                based on either the work as a whole<sup>[<a name="idp9985504" href="#ftn.idp9985504"
                                                            class="footnote">80</a>]</sup>,
                or based on the claimant's code contributions to the project. But
                though it is useful, both legally and politically, to build patent
                defenses into free software licenses in this way, in the end these
                protections are not be enough to dispel the chilling effect that the
                threat of patent lawsuits has on free software. Only changes in the
                substance or interpretation of international patent law will do
                that.</p>

                have made the future of software patents unpredictable. But there is

                    trolls</a> but in general by any entity with a large patent
                portfolio and a lack of other revenue sources, that I am not

                reasons why software patents are a bad idea are just as true now as

            <p>This chapter has only been an introduction to free software
                licensing, trademark, and patent issues. Although I hope it contains
                enough information to get you started on your own open source project,
                any serious investigation of legal issues will quickly exhaust what
                this book can provide. Here are some other resources:</p>

                Years after these
                events, I served as a member of the Board of Directors
                of the Open Source Initiative for three years, from
                2011-2014. The ideological gap between the OSI and the
                FSF is much smaller these days than it was when the OSI
                was founded, in my opinion, and lately the two
                organizations have increasingly found common ground on
                which to cooperate. I remain a happy member of both,

                The history of the license and its name is a bit complicated. The
                first version of the license was originally released by Affero, Inc,
                who based it on the GNU GPL version 2. At the time, this was commonly
                referred to as the AGPL. Later, the Free Software Foundation decided
                to adopt the idea, but by then they had released version 3 of their
                GNU GPL, so they based their new Affero-ized license on that and
                called it the "GNU AGPL". The old Affero license is now rarely used
                and is more or less deprecated, but to avoid ambiguity, say "AGPL-3.0"
                or "GNU AGPL" to make it clear that you're referring to the modern GNU
                version of the license.</p></div>
            <div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp9906704" href="#idp9906704" class="para">73</a>] </sup>Also,
                actual copyright transferral is subject to national law, and licenses
                designed for the United States may encounter problems elsewhere (e.g.,
                in Germany, where it's apparently not possible to transfer
                copyright).</p></div>

                sometimes also called <em class="firstterm">dual
                    licensing</em>, but that term is ambiguous, as it has
                historically also referred to releasing open source software under two
                or more open source licenses simultaneously. I am grateful to Bradley
                Kuhn for pointing out this ambiguity and suggesting the more accurate

                of exactly what changes Debian makes to the Firefox code that Mozilla

            <p>This appendix used to contain the complete text of Poul-Henning
                Kamp's famous "bikeshed" post, an excerpt from which appears in <a class="xref" href="#communications"
                                                                                   title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Communications">Chapter&nbsp;6,
                    <i>Communications</i></a>). It is an eloquent disquisition on what
                tends to go wrong in group discussions, but to save space I no longer
                include it as an appendix in this book. You can view the original

License:

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of
      this License.

   c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
      listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
      been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially
      equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because
      that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose,
      meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
      (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works
      made available under that license under this License or a
      Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License
      Elements as this License.

   g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
      created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
      identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
      performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
      persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
      otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of
      folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
      person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
      broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

   h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
      entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
      without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
      of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
      lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
      expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of
      applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or

      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
      as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or
      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
      literary or artistic work.

   i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this
      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      License despite a previous violation.

   j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
      Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations,
      by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or
      public digital performances; to make available to the public
      Works in such a way that members of the public may access these
      Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
      to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and
      the communication to the public of the performances of the Work,
      including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
      rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
      images.

   k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
      including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and
      the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,
      including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
      digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights.

   Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict
   any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
   exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
   protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
   hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
            cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
            right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
            the rights granted under this License;

        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can
            be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
            collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
            rights granted under this License; and,

       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
            to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the
            event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
            society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
            that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
            granted under this License.

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
   now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
   to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
   the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
   rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. 

   The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
   and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
      this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
      the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
      intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
      disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(c), as requested.

   b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under
      the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this
      License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a
      Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later
      license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
      License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative
      Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
      one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the
      terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the
      terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
      (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of
      the Applicable License generally and the following provisions:
      (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable
      License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
      Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on
      the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License
      or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
      the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
      Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
      refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
      Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not
      impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation
      that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from
      You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
      terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to
      the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
      not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to
      be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

   c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may
      be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
      the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
      the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
      may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
      of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
      Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
      explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
      the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
      (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
      would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
      other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
      appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
      the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
      exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
      make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
      1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
      License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
      the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights
      granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
      rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
      are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
      intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
      law.

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
            cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
            right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
            the rights granted under this License;

        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can
            be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
            collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
            rights granted under this License; and,

       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
            to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the
            event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
            society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
            that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
            granted under this License.

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
   now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
   to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
   the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
   rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. 

   The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
   and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
      this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
      the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
      intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
      disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(c), as requested.

   b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under
      the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this
      License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a
      Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later
      license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
      License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative
      Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
      one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the
      terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the
      terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
      (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of
      the Applicable License generally and the following provisions:
      (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable
      License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
      Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on
      the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License
      or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
      the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
      Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
      refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
      Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not
      impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation
      that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from
      You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
      terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to
      the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
      not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to
      be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

   c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may
      be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
      the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
      the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
      may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
      of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
      Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
      explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
      the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
      (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
      would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
      other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
      appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
      the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
      exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
      make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
      1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
      License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
      the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights
      granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
      rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
      are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
      intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
      law.
